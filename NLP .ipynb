       "CHAPTER I. LASSITER\n",
       "\n",
       "A sharp clip-crop of iron-shod hoofs deadened and died away, and clouds\n",
       "of yellow dust drifted from under the cottonwoods out over the sage.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane Withersteen gazed down the wide purple slope with dreamy and\n",
       "troubled eyes. A rider had just left her and it was his message that\n",
       "held her thoughtful and almost sad, awaiting the churchmen who were\n",
       "coming to resent and attack her right to befriend a Gentile.\n",
       "\n",
       "She wondered if the unrest and strife that had lately come to the\n",
       "little village of Cottonwoods was to involve her. And then she sighed,\n",
       "remembering that her father had founded this remotest border settlement\n",
       "of southern Utah and that he had left it to her. She owned all the\n",
       "ground and many of the cottages. Withersteen House was hers, and the\n",
       "great ranch, with its thousands of cattle, and the swiftest horses of\n",
       "the sage. To her belonged Amber Spring, the water which gave verdure\n",
       "and beauty to the village and made living possible on that wild purple\n",
       "upland waste. She could not escape being involved by whatever befell\n",
       "Cottonwoods.\n",
       "\n",
       "That year, 1871, had marked a change which had been gradually coming\n",
       "in the lives of the peace-loving Mormons of the border. Glaze--Stone\n",
       "Bridge--Sterling, villages to the north, had risen against the\n",
       "invasion of Gentile settlers and the forays of rustlers. There had been\n",
       "opposition to the one and fighting with the other. And now Cottonwoods\n",
       "had begun to wake and bestir itself and grown hard.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane prayed that the tranquillity and sweetness of her life would not be\n",
       "permanently disrupted. She meant to do so much more for her people than\n",
       "she had done. She wanted the sleepy quiet pastoral days to last always.\n",
       "Trouble between the Mormons and the Gentiles of the community would\n",
       "make her unhappy. She was Mormon-born, and she was a friend to poor\n",
       "and unfortunate Gentiles. She wished only to go on doing good and being\n",
       "happy. And she thought of what that great ranch meant to her. She loved\n",
       "it all--the grove of cottonwoods, the old stone house, the amber-tinted\n",
       "water, and the droves of shaggy, dusty horses and mustangs, the sleek,\n",
       "clean-limbed, blooded racers, and the browsing herds of cattle and the\n",
       "lean, sun-browned riders of the sage.\n",
       "\n",
       "While she waited there she forgot the prospect of untoward change. The\n",
       "bray of a lazy burro broke the afternoon quiet, and it was comfortingly\n",
       "suggestive of the drowsy farmyard, and the open corrals, and the green\n",
       "alfalfa fields. Her clear sight intensified the purple sage-slope as it\n",
       "rolled before her. Low swells of prairie-like ground sloped up to\n",
       "the west. Dark, lonely cedar-trees, few and far between, stood out\n",
       "strikingly, and at long distances ruins of red rocks. Farther on, up the\n",
       "gradual slope, rose a broken wall, a huge monument, looming dark purple\n",
       "and stretching its solitary, mystic way, a wavering line that faded\n",
       "in the north. Here to the westward was the light and color and beauty.\n",
       "Northward the slope descended to a dim line of canyons from which rose\n",
       "an up-flinging of the earth, not mountainous, but a vast heave of purple\n",
       "uplands, with ribbed and fan-shaped walls, castle-crowned cliffs, and\n",
       "gray escarpments. Over it all crept the lengthening, waning afternoon\n",
       "shadows.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rapid beat of hoofs recalled Jane Withersteen to the question at\n",
       "hand. A group of riders cantered up the lane, dismounted, and threw\n",
       "their bridles. They were seven in number, and Tull, the leader, a tall,\n",
       "dark man, was an elder of Jane's church.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Did you get my message?” he asked, curtly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes,” replied Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I sent word I'd give that rider Venters half an hour to come down to\n",
       "the village. He didn't come.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“He knows nothing of it;” said Jane. “I didn't tell him. I've been\n",
       "waiting here for you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Where is Venters?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I left him in the courtyard.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Here, Jerry,” called Tull, turning to his men, “take the gang and fetch\n",
       "Venters out here if you have to rope him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The dusty-booted and long-spurred riders clanked noisily into the grove\n",
       "of cottonwoods and disappeared in the shade.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Elder Tull, what do you mean by this?” demanded Jane. “If you must\n",
       "arrest Venters you might have the courtesy to wait till he leaves my\n",
       "home. And if you do arrest him it will be adding insult to injury. It's\n",
       "absurd to accuse Venters of being mixed up in that shooting fray in the\n",
       "village last night. He was with me at the time. Besides, he let me take\n",
       "charge of his guns. You're only using this as a pretext. What do you\n",
       "mean to do to Venters?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'll tell you presently,” replied Tull. “But first tell me why you\n",
       "defend this worthless rider?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Worthless!” exclaimed Jane, indignantly. “He's nothing of the kind.\n",
       "He was the best rider I ever had. There's not a reason why I shouldn't\n",
       "champion him and every reason why I should. It's no little shame to me,\n",
       "Elder Tull, that through my friendship he has roused the enmity of my\n",
       "people and become an outcast. Besides I owe him eternal gratitude for\n",
       "saving the life of little Fay.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I've heard of your love for Fay Larkin and that you intend to adopt\n",
       "her. But--Jane Withersteen, the child is a Gentile!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes. But, Elder, I don't love the Mormon children any less because I\n",
       "love a Gentile child. I shall adopt Fay if her mother will give her to\n",
       "me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm not so much against that. You can give the child Mormon teaching,”\n",
       " said Tull. “But I'm sick of seeing this fellow Venters hang around you.\n",
       "I'm going to put a stop to it. You've so much love to throw away on\n",
       "these beggars of Gentiles that I've an idea you might love Venters.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Tull spoke with the arrogance of a Mormon whose power could not be\n",
       "brooked and with the passion of a man in whom jealousy had kindled a\n",
       "consuming fire.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Maybe I do love him,” said Jane. She felt both fear and anger stir her\n",
       "heart. “I'd never thought of that. Poor fellow! he certainly needs some\n",
       "one to love him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“This'll be a bad day for Venters unless you deny that,” returned Tull,\n",
       "grimly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Tull's men appeared under the cottonwoods and led a young man out into\n",
       "the lane. His ragged clothes were those of an outcast. But he stood tall\n",
       "and straight, his wide shoulders flung back, with the muscles of his\n",
       "bound arms rippling and a blue flame of defiance in the gaze he bent on\n",
       "Tull.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the first time Jane Withersteen felt Venters's real spirit. She\n",
       "wondered if she would love this splendid youth. Then her emotion cooled\n",
       "to the sobering sense of the issue at stake.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Venters, will you leave Cottonwoods at once and forever?” asked Tull,\n",
       "tensely.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why?” rejoined the rider.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Because I order it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters laughed in cool disdain.\n",
       "\n",
       "The red leaped to Tull's dark cheek.\n",
       "\n",
       "“If you don't go it means your ruin,” he said, sharply.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ruin!” exclaimed Venters, passionately. “Haven't you already ruined me?\n",
       "What do you call ruin? A year ago I was a rider. I had horses and cattle\n",
       "of my own. I had a good name in Cottonwoods. And now when I come into\n",
       "the village to see this woman you set your men on me. You hound me. You\n",
       "trail me as if I were a rustler. I've no more to lose--except my life.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Will you leave Utah?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh! I know,” went on Venters, tauntingly, “it galls you, the idea of\n",
       "beautiful Jane Withersteen being friendly to a poor Gentile. You want\n",
       "her all yourself. You're a wiving Mormon. You have use for her--and\n",
       "Withersteen House and Amber Spring and seven thousand head of cattle!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Tull's hard jaw protruded, and rioting blood corded the veins of his\n",
       "neck.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Once more. Will you go?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“NO!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Then I'll have you whipped within an inch of your life,” replied Tull,\n",
       "harshly. “I'll turn you out in the sage. And if you ever come back\n",
       "you'll get worse.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters's agitated face grew coldly set and the bronze changed\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane impulsively stepped forward. “Oh! Elder Tull!” she cried. “You\n",
       "won't do that!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Tull lifted a shaking finger toward her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That'll do from you. Understand, you'll not be allowed to hold this boy\n",
       "to a friendship that's offensive to your Bishop. Jane Withersteen, your\n",
       "father left you wealth and power. It has turned your head. You haven't\n",
       "yet come to see the place of Mormon women. We've reasoned with you,\n",
       "borne with you. We've patiently waited. We've let you have your fling,\n",
       "which is more than I ever saw granted to a Mormon woman. But you haven't\n",
       "come to your senses. Now, once for all, you can't have any further\n",
       "friendship with Venters. He's going to be whipped, and he's got to leave\n",
       "Utah!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh! Don't whip him! It would be dastardly!” implored Jane, with slow\n",
       "certainty of her failing courage.\n",
       "\n",
       "Tull always blunted her spirit, and she grew conscious that she had\n",
       "feigned a boldness which she did not possess. He loomed up now in\n",
       "different guise, not as a jealous suitor, but embodying the mysterious\n",
       "despotism she had known from childhood--the power of her creed.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Venters, will you take your whipping here or would you rather go out\n",
       "in the sage?” asked Tull. He smiled a flinty smile that was more\n",
       "than inhuman, yet seemed to give out of its dark aloofness a gleam of\n",
       "righteousness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'll take it here--if I must,” said Venters. “But by God!--Tull you'd\n",
       "better kill me outright. That'll be a dear whipping for you and your\n",
       "praying Mormons. You'll make me another Lassiter!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The strange glow, the austere light which radiated from Tull's face,\n",
       "might have been a holy joy at the spiritual conception of exalted duty.\n",
       "But there was something more in him, barely hidden, a something personal\n",
       "and sinister, a deep of himself, an engulfing abyss. As his religious\n",
       "mood was fanatical and inexorable, so would his physical hate be\n",
       "merciless.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Elder, I--I repent my words,” Jane faltered. The religion in her, the\n",
       "long habit of obedience, of humility, as well as agony of fear, spoke in\n",
       "her voice. “Spare the boy!” she whispered.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You can't save him now,” replied Tull stridently.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her head was bowing to the inevitable. She was grasping the truth,\n",
       "when suddenly there came, in inward constriction, a hardening of gentle\n",
       "forces within her breast. Like a steel bar it was stiffening all that\n",
       "had been soft and weak in her. She felt a birth in her of something new\n",
       "and unintelligible. Once more her strained gaze sought the sage-slopes.\n",
       "Jane Withersteen loved that wild and purple wilderness. In times\n",
       "of sorrow it had been her strength, in happiness its beauty was her\n",
       "continual delight. In her extremity she found herself murmuring, “Whence\n",
       "cometh my help!” It was a prayer, as if forth from those lonely purple\n",
       "reaches and walls of red and clefts of blue might ride a fearless man,\n",
       "neither creed-bound nor creed-mad, who would hold up a restraining hand\n",
       "in the faces of her ruthless people.\n",
       "\n",
       "The restless movements of Tull's men suddenly quieted down. Then\n",
       "followed a low whisper, a rustle, a sharp exclamation.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Look!” said one, pointing to the west.\n",
       "\n",
       "“A rider!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane Withersteen wheeled and saw a horseman, silhouetted against the\n",
       "western sky, coming riding out of the sage. He had ridden down from the\n",
       "left, in the golden glare of the sun, and had been unobserved till close\n",
       "at hand. An answer to her prayer!\n",
       "\n",
       "“Do you know him? Does any one know him?” questioned Tull, hurriedly.\n",
       "\n",
       "His men looked and looked, and one by one shook their heads.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He's come from far,” said one.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Thet's a fine hoss,” said another.\n",
       "\n",
       "“A strange rider.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Huh! he wears black leather,” added a fourth.\n",
       "\n",
       "With a wave of his hand, enjoining silence, Tull stepped forward in such\n",
       "a way that he concealed Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rider reined in his mount, and with a lithe forward-slipping\n",
       "action appeared to reach the ground in one long step. It was a peculiar\n",
       "movement in its quickness and inasmuch that while performing it the\n",
       "rider did not swerve in the slightest from a square front to the group\n",
       "before him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Look!” hoarsely whispered one of Tull's companions. “He packs two\n",
       "black-butted guns--low down--they're hard to see--black akin them black\n",
       "chaps.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“A gun-man!” whispered another. “Fellers, careful now about movin' your\n",
       "hands.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The stranger's slow approach might have been a mere leisurely manner of\n",
       "gait or the cramped short steps of a rider unused to walking; yet, as\n",
       "well, it could have been the guarded advance of one who took no chances\n",
       "with men.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hello, stranger!” called Tull. No welcome was in this greeting only a\n",
       "gruff curiosity.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rider responded with a curt nod. The wide brim of a black sombrero\n",
       "cast a dark shade over his face. For a moment he closely regarded Tull\n",
       "and his comrades, and then, halting in his slow walk, he seemed to\n",
       "relax.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Evenin', ma'am,” he said to Jane, and removed his sombrero with quaint\n",
       "grace.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane, greeting him, looked up into a face that she trusted instinctively\n",
       "and which riveted her attention. It had all the characteristics of\n",
       "the range rider's--the leanness, the red burn of the sun, and the set\n",
       "changelessness that came from years of silence and solitude. But it was\n",
       "not these which held her, rather the intensity of his gaze, a strained\n",
       "weariness, a piercing wistfulness of keen, gray sight, as if the man\n",
       "was forever looking for that which he never found. Jane's subtle woman's\n",
       "intuition, even in that brief instant, felt a sadness, a hungering, a\n",
       "secret.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane Withersteen, ma'am?” he inquired.\n",
       "\n",

       "addressing Jane, he had been mild and gentle, now, with his first speech\n",
       "to Tull, he was dry, cool, biting. “I've lest stumbled onto a queer\n",
       "deal. Seven Mormons all packin' guns, an' a Gentile tied with a rope,\n",
       "an' a woman who swears by his honesty! Queer, ain't that?”\n",

       "\n",
       "“I will water him myself,” she said, and she led the horse to a trough\n",
       "under a huge old cottonwood. With nimble fingers she loosened the bridle\n",
       "and removed the bit. The horse snorted and bent his head. The trough was\n",
       "of solid stone, hollowed out, moss-covered and green and wet and cool,\n",
       "and the clear brown water that fed it spouted and splashed from a wooden\n",

       "\n",
       "“No. I believe Mormon women are the best and noblest, the most\n",

       "bars through the leaves. The grass was deep and rich, welcome contrast\n",
       "to sage-tired eyes. Twittering quail darted across the path, and from a\n",
       "tree-top somewhere a robin sang its evening song, and on the still air\n",
       "floated the freshness and murmur of flowing water.\n",
       "\n",
       "The home of Jane Withersteen stood in a circle of cottonwoods, and was\n",
       "a flat, long, red-stone structure with a covered court in the center\n",
       "through which flowed a lively stream of amber-colored water. In the\n",
       "massive blocks of stone and heavy timbers and solid doors and shutters\n",
       "showed the hand of a man who had builded against pillage and time; and\n",
       "in the flowers and mosses lining the stone-bedded stream, in the bright\n",
       "colors of rugs and blankets on the court floor, and the cozy corner with\n",
       "hammock and books and the clean-linened table, showed the grace of a\n",
       "daughter who lived for happiness and the day at hand.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane turned Lassiter's horse loose in the thick grass. “You will want\n",
       "him to be near you,” she said, “or I'd have him taken to the alfalfa\n",
       "fields.” At her call appeared women who began at once to bustle about,\n",
       "hurrying to and fro, setting the table. Then Jane, excusing herself,\n",

       "She passed through a huge low ceiled chamber, like the inside of a fort,\n",
       "and into a smaller one where a bright wood-fire blazed in an old open\n",
       "fireplace, and from this into her own room. It had the same comfort as\n",
       "was manifested in the home-like outer court; moreover, it was warm and\n",
       "rich in soft hues.\n",
       "\n",
       "Seldom did Jane Withersteen enter her room without looking into her\n",

       "early childhood she had never been allowed to forget. Her relatives and\n",
       "friends, and later a horde of Mormon and Gentile suitors, had fanned\n",
       "the flame of natural vanity in her. So that at twenty-eight she scarcely\n",
       "thought at all of her wonderful influence for good in the little\n",
       "community where her father had left her practically its beneficent\n",
       "landlord, but cared most for the dream and the assurance and the\n",
       "allurement of her beauty. This time, however, she gazed into her\n",
       "glass with more than the usual happy motive, without the usual slight\n",
       "conscious smile. For she was thinking of more than the desire to be fair\n",
       "in her own eyes, in those of her friend; she wondered if she were to\n",
       "seem fair in the eyes of this Lassiter, this man whose name had crossed\n",
       "the long, wild brakes of stone and plains of sage, this gentle-voiced,\n",
       "sad-faced man who was a hater and a killer of Mormons. It was not\n",
       "now her usual half-conscious vain obsession that actuated her as she\n",
       "hurriedly changed her riding-dress to one of white, and then looked long\n",
       "at the stately form with its gracious contours, at the fair face\n",
       "with its strong chin and full firm lips, at the dark-blue, proud, and\n",
       "passionate eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“If by some means I can keep him here a few days, a week--he will never\n",

       "of that name, of him. But when I look at the man I forget who he is--I\n",
       "almost like him. I remember only that he saved Bern. He has suffered. I\n",

       "\n",
       "Jane Withersteen joined her guests and bade them to her board.\n",
       "Dismissing her woman, she waited upon them with her own hands. It was a\n",
       "bountiful supper and a strange company. On her right sat the ragged\n",
       "and half-starved Venters; and though blind eyes could have seen what\n",
       "he counted for in the sum of her happiness, yet he looked the gloomy\n",
       "outcast his allegiance had made him, and about him there was the shadow\n",
       "of the ruin presaged by Tull. On her left sat black-leather-garbed\n",
       "Lassiter looking like a man in a dream. Hunger was not with him, nor\n",
       "composure, nor speech, and when he twisted in frequent unquiet movements\n",
       "the heavy guns that he had not removed knocked against the table-legs.\n",
       "If it had been otherwise possible to forget the presence of Lassiter\n",
       "those telling little jars would have rendered it unlikely. And Jane\n",
       "Withersteen talked and smiled and laughed with all the dazzling play\n",
       "of lips and eyes that a beautiful, daring woman could summon to her\n",
       "purpose.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the meal ended, and the men pushed back their chairs, she leaned\n",
       "closer to Lassiter and looked square into his eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why did you come to Cottonwoods?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Her question seemed to break a spell. The rider arose as if he had just\n",
       "remembered himself and had tarried longer than his wont.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ma'am, I have hunted all over the southern Utah and Nevada\n",
       "for--somethin'. An' through your name I learned where to find it--here\n",
       "in Cottonwoods.”\n",
       "\n",

       "“At the little village--Glaze, I think it's called--some fifty miles or\n",

       "know where to tell me to find--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What?” she demanded, imperiously, as Lassiter broke off.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Milly Erne's grave,” he answered low, and the words came with a wrench.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters wheeled in his chair to regard Lassiter in amazement, and Jane\n",
       "slowly raised herself in white, still wonder.\n",

       "to her?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Did I claim to be anythin'?” he inquired. “I know\n",
       "people--relatives--who have long wanted to know where she's buried,\n",
       "that's all.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Relatives? She never spoke of relatives, except a brother who was shot\n",
       "in Texas. Lassiter, Milly Erne's grave is in a secret burying-ground on\n",
       "my property.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Will you take me there?... You'll be offendin' Mormons worse than by\n",
       "breakin' bread with me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Indeed yes, but I'll do it. Only we must go unseen. To-morrow,\n",
       "perhaps.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Thank you, Jane Withersteen,” replied the rider, and he bowed to her\n",
       "and stepped backward out of the court.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Will you not stay--sleep under my roof?” she asked.\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, ma'am, an' thanks again. I never sleep indoors. An' even if I did\n",

       "often. I've never been in a village which he had been known to visit.\n",
       "There were many conflicting stories about him and his doings. Some said\n",
       "he had shot up this and that Mormon village, and others denied it. I'm\n",
       "inclined to believe he has, and you know how Mormons hide the truth. But\n",
       "there was one feature about Lassiter upon which all agree--that he was\n",
       "what riders in this country call a gun-man. He's a man with a marvelous\n",
       "quickness and accuracy in the use of a Colt. And now that I've seen him\n",

       "from what had been told me of his crouch before the draw. It was then I\n",

       "to the village--who can tell? Suppose you discovered the long-unknown\n",
       "hiding-place of Oldring and his band, and told it to my riders? That\n",
       "would disarm Tull's ugly hints and put you in favor. For years my riders\n",
       "have trailed the tracks of stolen cattle. You know as well as I how\n",
       "dearly we've paid for our ranges in this wild country. Oldring drives\n",
       "our cattle down into the network of deceiving canyons, and somewhere far\n",
       "to the north or east he drives them up and out to Utah markets. If you\n",

       "reached the house, and then, taking up his rifle, he noiselessly slipped\n",
       "through the bushes, down the knoll, and on under the dark trees to the\n",
       "edge of the grove. The sky was now turning from gray to blue; stars had\n",
       "begun to lighten the earlier blackness; and from the wide flat sweep\n",
       "before him blew a cool wind, fragrant with the breath of sage. Keeping\n",
       "close to the edge of the cottonwoods, he went swiftly and silently\n",
       "westward. The grove was long, and he had not reached the end when he\n",
       "heard something that brought him to a halt. Low padded thuds told\n",
       "him horses were coming this way. He sank down in the gloom, waiting,\n",
       "listening. Much before he had expected, judging from sound, to his\n",
       "amazement he descried horsemen near at hand. They were riding along the\n",
       "border of the sage, and instantly he knew the hoofs of the horses were\n",
       "muffled. Then the pale starlight afforded him indistinct sight of the\n",
       "riders. But his eyes were keen and used to the dark, and by peering\n",
       "closely he recognized the huge bulk and black-bearded visage of Oldring\n",
       "and the lithe, supple form of the rustler's lieutenant, a masked rider.\n",
       "They passed on; the darkness swallowed them. Then, farther out on the\n",
       "sage, a dark, compact body of horsemen went by, almost without sound,\n",
       "almost like specters, and they, too, melted into the night.\n",

       "No unusual circumstances was it for Oldring and some of his men to visit\n",
       "Cottonwoods in the broad light of day, but for him to prowl about in\n",
       "the dark with the hoofs of his horses muffled meant that mischief was\n",
       "brewing. Moreover, to Venters the presence of the masked rider with\n",
       "Oldring seemed especially ominous. For about this man there was mystery,\n",
       "he seldom rode through the village, and when he did ride through it\n",
       "was swiftly; riders seldom met by day on the sage, but wherever he rode\n",
       "there always followed deeds as dark and mysterious as the mask he wore.\n",
       "Oldring's band did not confine themselves to the rustling of cattle.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters lay low in the shade of the cottonwoods, pondering this chance\n",
       "meeting, and not for many moments did he consider it safe to move on.\n",
       "Then, with sudden impulse, he turned the other way and went back along\n",
       "the grove. When he reached the path leading to Jane's home he decided\n",
       "to go down to the village. So he hurried onward, with quick soft steps.\n",
       "Once beyond the grove he entered the one and only street. It was\n",
       "wide, lined with tall poplars, and under each row of trees, inside the\n",
       "foot-path, were ditches where ran the water from Jane Withersteen's\n",
       "spring.\n",
       "\n",
       "Between the trees twinkled lights of cottage candles, and far down\n",
       "flared bright windows of the village stores. When Venters got closer to\n",
       "these he saw knots of men standing together in earnest conversation. The\n",
       "usual lounging on the corners and benches and steps was not in evidence.\n",
       "Keeping in the shadow Venters went closer and closer until he could hear\n",
       "voices. But he could not distinguish what was said. He recognized many\n",
       "Mormons, and looked hard for Tull and his men, but looked in vain.\n",
       "Venters concluded that the rustlers had not passed along the village\n",
       "street. No doubt these earnest men were discussing Lassiter's coming.\n",
       "But Venters felt positive that Tull's intention toward himself that day\n",
       "had not been and would not be revealed.\n",
       "\n",
       "So Venters, seeing there was little for him to learn, began retracing\n",
       "his steps. The church was dark, Bishop Dyer's home next to it was also\n",
       "dark, and likewise Tull's cottage. Upon almost any night at this hour\n",
       "there would be lights here, and Venters marked the unusual omission.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he was about to pass out of the street to skirt the grove, he once\n",
       "more slunk down at the sound of trotting horses. Presently he descried\n",
       "two mounted men riding toward him. He hugged the shadow of a tree. Again\n",
       "the starlight, brighter now, aided him, and he made out Tull's stalwart\n",
       "figure, and beside him the short, froglike shape of the rider Jerry.\n",
       "They were silent, and they rode on to disappear.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters went his way with busy, gloomy mind, revolving events of\n",
       "the day, trying to reckon those brooding in the night. His thoughts\n",
       "overwhelmed him. Up in that dark grove dwelt a woman who had been his\n",
       "friend. And he skulked about her home, gripping a gun stealthily as an\n",
       "Indian, a man without place or people or purpose. Above her hovered the\n",
       "shadow of grim, hidden, secret power. No queen could have given more\n",
       "royally out of a bounteous store than Jane Withersteen gave her people,\n",
       "and likewise to those unfortunates whom her people hated. She asked only\n",
       "the divine right of all women--freedom; to love and to live as her heart\n",
       "willed. And yet prayer and her hope were vain.\n",
       "\n",
       "“For years I've seen a storm clouding over her and the village of\n",
       "Cottonwoods,” muttered Venters, as he strode on. “Soon it'll burst. I\n",
       "don't like the prospects.” That night the villagers whispered in the\n",
       "street--and night-riding rustlers muffled horses--and Tull was at work\n",
       "in secret--and out there in the sage hid a man who meant something\n",
       "terrible--Lassiter!\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters passed the black cottonwoods, and, entering the sage, climbed\n",
       "the gradual slope. He kept his direction in line with a western star.\n",
       "From time to time he stopped to listen and heard only the usual familiar\n",
       "bark of coyote and sweep of wind and rustle of sage. Presently a low\n",
       "jumble of rocks loomed up darkly somewhat to his right, and, turning\n",
       "that way, he whistled softly. Out of the rocks glided a dog that leaped\n",
       "and whined about him. He climbed over rough, broken rock, picking his\n",
       "way carefully, and then went down. Here it was darker, and sheltered\n",
       "from the wind. A white object guided him. It was another dog, and this\n",
       "one was asleep, curled up between a saddle and a pack. The animal\n",
       "awoke and thumped his tail in greeting. Venters placed the saddle for a\n",
       "pillow, rolled in his blankets, with his face upward to the stars. The\n",
       "white dog snuggled close to him. The other whined and pattered a few\n",
       "yards to the rise of ground and there crouched on guard. And in that\n",
       "wild covert Venters shut his eyes under the great white stars and\n",
       "intense vaulted blue, bitterly comparing their loneliness to his own,\n",
       "and fell asleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "When he awoke, day had dawned and all about him was bright steel-gray.\n",
       "The air had a cold tang. Arising, he greeted the fawning dogs and\n",
       "stretched his cramped body, and then, gathering together bunches of dead\n",
       "sage sticks, he lighted a fire. Strips of dried beef held to the blaze\n",
       "for a moment served him and the dogs. He drank from a canteen. There was\n",
       "nothing else in his outfit; he had grown used to a scant fire. Then he\n",
       "sat over the fire, palms outspread, and waited. Waiting had been his\n",
       "chief occupation for months, and he scarcely knew what he waited for\n",
       "unless it was the passing of the hours. But now he sensed action in the\n",
       "immediate present; the day promised another meeting with Lassiter and\n",
       "Jane, perhaps news of the rustlers; on the morrow he meant to take the\n",
       "trail to Deception Pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "And while he waited he talked to his dogs. He called them Ring and\n",
       "Whitie; they were sheep-dogs, half collie, half deerhound, superb in\n",
       "build, perfectly trained. It seemed that in his fallen fortunes these\n",
       "dogs understood the nature of their value to him, and governed their\n",
       "affection and faithfulness accordingly. Whitie watched him with somber\n",
       "eyes of love, and Ring, crouched on the little rise of ground above,\n",
       "kept tireless guard. When the sun rose, the white dog took the place of\n",
       "the other, and Ring went to sleep at his master's feet.\n",
       "\n",
       "By and by Venters rolled up his blankets and tied them and his meager\n",
       "pack together, then climbed out to look for his horse. He saw him,\n",
       "presently, a little way off in the sage, and went to fetch him. In that\n",
       "country, where every rider boasted of a fine mount and was eager for a\n",
       "race, where thoroughbreds dotted the wonderful grazing ranges, Venters\n",
       "rode a horse that was sad proof of his misfortunes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, with his back against a stone, Venters faced the east, and, stick\n",
       "in hand and idle blade, he waited. The glorious sunlight filled the\n",
       "valley with purple fire. Before him, to left, to right, waving, rolling,\n",
       "sinking, rising, like low swells of a purple sea, stretched the sage.\n",
       "Out of the grove of cottonwoods, a green patch on the purple, gleamed\n",
       "the dull red of Jane Withersteen's old stone house. And from there\n",
       "extended the wide green of the village gardens and orchards marked by\n",
       "the graceful poplars; and farther down shone the deep, dark richness of\n",
       "the alfalfa fields. Numberless red and black and white dots speckled the\n",
       "sage, and these were cattle and horses.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, watching and waiting, Venters let the time wear away. At length he\n",
       "saw a horse rise above a ridge, and he knew it to be Lassiter's\n",
       "black. Climbing to the highest rock, so that he would show against the\n",
       "sky-line, he stood and waved his hat. The almost instant turning of\n",
       "Lassiter's horse attested to the quickness of that rider's eye. Then\n",
       "Venters climbed down, saddled his horse, tied on his pack, and, with\n",
       "a word to his dogs, was about to ride out to meet Lassiter, when he\n",
       "concluded to wait for him there, on higher ground, where the outlook was\n",
       "commanding.\n",
       "\n",
       "It had been long since Venters had experienced friendly greeting from\n",
       "a man. Lassiter's warmed in him something that had grown cold from\n",
       "neglect. And when he had returned it, with a strong grip of the iron\n",
       "hand that held his, and met the gray eyes, he knew that Lassiter and he\n",
       "were to be friends.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Venters, let's talk awhile before we go down there,” said Lassiter,\n",
       "slipping his bridle. “I ain't in no hurry. Them's sure fine dogs you've\n",
       "got.” With a rider's eye he took in the points of Venter's horse, but\n",
       "did not speak his thought. “Well, did anythin' come off after I left you\n",
       "last night?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters told him about the rustlers.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I was snug hid in the sage,” replied Lassiter, “an' didn't see or hear\n",
       "no one. Oldrin's got a high hand here, I reckon. It's no news up in\n",
       "Utah how he holes in canyons an' leaves no track.” Lassiter was silent a\n",
       "moment. “Me an' Oldrin' wasn't exactly strangers some years back when he\n",
       "drove cattle into Bostil's Ford, at the head of the Rio Virgin. But he\n",
       "got harassed there an' now he drives some place else.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, you knew him? Tell me, is he Mormon or Gentile?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I can't say. I've knowed Mormons who pretended to be Gentiles.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No Mormon ever pretended that unless he was a rustler,” declared\n",
       "Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Mebbe so.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's a hard country for any one, but hardest for Gentiles. Did you ever\n",
       "know or hear of a Gentile prospering in a Mormon community?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I never did.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, I want to get out of Utah. I've a mother living in Illinois. I\n",
       "want to go home. It's eight years now.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The older man's sympathy moved Venters to tell his story. He had left\n",
       "Quincy, run off to seek his fortune in the gold fields had never gotten\n",
       "any farther than Salt Lake City, wandered here and there as helper,\n",
       "teamster, shepherd, and drifted southward over the divide and across the\n",
       "barrens and up the rugged plateau through the passes to the last border\n",
       "settlements. Here he became a rider of the sage, had stock of his own,\n",
       "and for a time prospered, until chance threw him in the employ of Jane\n",
       "Withersteen.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, I needn't tell you the rest.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, it'd be no news to me. I know Mormons. I've seen their women's\n",
       "strange love en' patience en' sacrifice an' silence en' whet I call\n",
       "madness for their idea of God. An' over against that I've seen the\n",
       "tricks of men. They work hand in hand, all together, an' in the dark.\n",
       "No man can hold out against them, unless he takes to packin' guns. For\n",
       "Mormons are slow to kill. That's the only good I ever seen in their\n",
       "religion. Venters, take this from me, these Mormons ain't just right in\n",
       "their minds. Else could a Mormon marry one woman when he already has a\n",
       "wife, an' call it duty?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, you think as I think,” returned Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“How'd it come then that you never throwed a gun on Tull or some of\n",
       "them?” inquired the rider, curiously.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane pleaded with me, begged me to be patient, to overlook. She even\n",
       "took my guns from me. I lost all before I knew it,” replied Venters,\n",
       "with the red color in his face. “But, Lassiter, listen. Out of the\n",
       "wreck I saved a Winchester, two Colts, and plenty of shells. I packed\n",
       "these down into Deception Pass. There, almost every day for six months,\n",
       "I have practiced with my rifle till the barrel burnt my hands. Practised\n",
       "the draw--the firing of a Colt, hour after hour!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Now that's interestin' to me,” said Lassiter, with a quick uplift of\n",
       "his head and a concentration of his gray gaze on Venters. “Could you\n",
       "throw a gun before you began that practisin'?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes. And now...” Venters made a lightning-swift movement.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter smiled, and then his bronzed eyelids narrowed till his eyes\n",
       "seemed mere gray slits. “You'll kill Tull!” He did not question; he\n",
       "affirmed.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I promised Jane Withersteen I'd try to avoid Tull. I'll keep my word.\n",
       "But sooner or later Tull and I will meet. As I feel now, if he even\n",
       "looks at me I'll draw!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon so. There'll be hell down there, presently.” He paused a\n",
       "moment and flicked a sage-brush with his quirt. “Venters, seein' as\n",
       "you're considerable worked up, tell me Milly Erne's story.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters's agitation stilled to the trace of suppressed eagerness in\n",
       "Lassiter's query.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Milly Erne's story? Well, Lassiter, I'll tell you what I know. Milly\n",
       "Erne had been in Cottonwoods years when I first arrived there, and most\n",
       "of what I tell you happened before my arrival. I got to know her pretty\n",
       "well. She was a slip of a woman, and crazy on religion. I conceived an\n",
       "idea that I never mentioned--I thought she was at heart more Gentile\n",
       "than Mormon. But she passed as a Mormon, and certainly she had the\n",
       "Mormon woman's locked lips. You know, in every Mormon village there are\n",
       "women who seem mysterious to us, but about Milly there was more than\n",
       "the ordinary mystery. When she came to Cottonwoods she had a beautiful\n",
       "little girl whom she loved passionately. Milly was not known openly in\n",
       "Cottonwoods as a Mormon wife. That she really was a Mormon wife I have\n",
       "no doubt. Perhaps the Mormon's other wife or wives would not acknowledge\n",
       "Milly. Such things happen in these villages. Mormon wives wear\n",
       "yokes, but they get jealous. Well, whatever had brought Milly to this\n",
       "country--love or madness of religion--she repented of it. She gave up\n",
       "teaching the village school. She quit the church. And she began to\n",
       "fight Mormon upbringing for her baby girl. Then the Mormons put on the\n",
       "screws--slowly, as is their way. At last the child disappeared. 'Lost'\n",
       "was the report. The child was stolen, I know that. So do you. That\n",
       "wrecked Milly Erne. But she lived on in hope. She became a slave. She\n",
       "worked her heart and soul and life out to get back her child. She never\n",
       "heard of it again. Then she sank.... I can see her now, a frail thing, so\n",
       "transparent you could almost look through her--white like ashes--and her\n",
       "eyes!... Her eyes have always haunted me. She had one real friend--Jane\n",
       "Withersteen. But Jane couldn't mend a broken heart, and Milly died.”\n",
       "\n",
       "For moments Lassiter did not speak, or turn his head.\n",
       "\n",
       "“The man!” he exclaimed, presently, in husky accents.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I haven't the slightest idea who the Mormon was,” replied Venters; “nor\n",
       "has any Gentile in Cottonwoods.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Does Jane Withersteen know?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes. But a red-hot running-iron couldn't burn that name out of her!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Without further speech Lassiter started off, walking his horse and\n",
       "Venters followed with his dogs. Half a mile down the slope they entered\n",
       "a luxuriant growth of willows, and soon came into an open space carpeted\n",
       "with grass like deep green velvet. The rushing of water and singing of\n",
       "birds filled their ears. Venters led his comrade to a shady bower and\n",
       "showed him Amber Spring. It was a magnificent outburst of clear, amber\n",
       "water pouring from a dark, stone-lined hole. Lassiter knelt and drank,\n",
       "lingered there to drink again. He made no comment, but Venters did not\n",
       "need words. Next to his horse a rider of the sage loved a spring. And\n",
       "this spring was the most beautiful and remarkable known to the upland\n",
       "riders of southern Utah. It was the spring that made old Withersteen a\n",
       "feudal lord and now enabled his daughter to return the toll which her\n",
       "father had exacted from the toilers of the sage.\n",
       "\n",
       "The spring gushed forth in a swirling torrent, and leaped down joyously\n",
       "to make its swift way along a willow-skirted channel. Moss and ferns and\n",
       "lilies overhung its green banks. Except for the rough-hewn stones that\n",
       "held and directed the water, this willow thicket and glade had been left\n",
       "as nature had made it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Below were artificial lakes, three in number, one above the other\n",
       "in banks of raised earth, and round about them rose the lofty\n",
       "green-foliaged shafts of poplar trees. Ducks dotted the glassy surface\n",
       "of the lakes; a blue heron stood motionless on a water-gate; kingfishers\n",
       "darted with shrieking flight along the shady banks; a white hawk\n",
       "sailed above; and from the trees and shrubs came the song of robins\n",
       "and cat-birds. It was all in strange contrast to the endless slopes of\n",
       "lonely sage and the wild rock environs beyond. Venters thought of the\n",
       "woman who loved the birds and the green of the leaves and the murmur of\n",
       "the water.\n",
       "\n",
       "Next on the slope, just below the third and largest lake, were corrals\n",
       "and a wide stone barn and open sheds and coops and pens. Here were\n",
       "clouds of dust, and cracking sounds of hoofs, and romping colts and\n",
       "heehawing burros. Neighing horses trampled to the corral fences. And\n",
       "on the little windows of the barn projected bobbing heads of bays and\n",
       "blacks and sorrels. When the two men entered the immense barnyard, from\n",
       "all around the din increased. This welcome, however, was not seconded by\n",
       "the several men and boys who vanished on sight.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters and Lassiter were turning toward the house when Jane appeared in\n",
       "the lane leading a horse. In riding-skirt and blouse she seemed to have\n",
       "lost some of her statuesque proportions, and looked more like a girl\n",
       "rider than the mistress of Withersteen. She was brightly smiling, and\n",
       "her greeting was warmly cordial.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Good news,” she announced. “I've been to the village. All is quiet.\n",
       "I expected--I don't know what. But there's no excitement. And Tull has\n",
       "ridden out on his way to Glaze.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Tull gone?” inquired Venters, with surprise. He was wondering what\n",
       "could have taken Tull away. Was it to avoid another meeting with\n",
       "Lassiter that he went? Could it have any connection with the probable\n",
       "nearness of Oldring and his gang?\n",
       "\n",
       "“Gone, yes, thank goodness,” replied Jane. “Now I'll have peace for a\n",
       "while. Lassiter, I want you to see my horses. You are a rider, and\n",
       "you must be a judge of horseflesh. Some of mine have Arabian blood.\n",
       "My father got his best strain in Nevada from Indians who claimed their\n",
       "horses were bred down from the original stock left by the Spaniards.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, ma'am, the one you've been ridin' takes my eye,” said Lassiter,\n",
       "as he walked round the racy, clean-limbed, and fine-pointed roan.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Where are the boys?” she asked, looking about. “Jerd, Paul, where are\n",
       "you? Here, bring out the horses.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The sound of dropping bars inside the barn was the signal for the horses\n",
       "to jerk their heads in the windows, to snort and stamp. Then they came\n",
       "pounding out of the door, a file of thoroughbreds, to plunge about\n",
       "the barnyard, heads and tails up, manes flying. They halted afar off,\n",
       "squared away to look, came slowly forward with whinnies for their\n",
       "mistress, and doubtful snorts for the strangers and their horses.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Come--come--come,” called Jane, holding out her hands. “Why,\n",
       "Bells--Wrangle, where are your manners? Come, Black Star--come, Night.\n",
       "Ah, you beauties! My racers of the sage!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Only two came up to her; those she called Night and Black Star. Venters\n",
       "never looked at them without delight. The first was soft dead black, the\n",
       "other glittering black, and they were perfectly matched in size, both\n",
       "being high and long-bodied, wide through the shoulders, with lithe,\n",
       "powerful legs. That they were a woman's pets showed in the gloss of\n",
       "skin, the fineness of mane. It showed, too, in the light of big eyes and\n",
       "the gentle reach of eagerness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I never seen their like,” was Lassiter's encomium, “an' in my day I've\n",
       "seen a sight of horses. Now, ma'am, if you was wantin' to make a long\n",
       "an' fast ride across the sage--say to elope--”\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter ended there with dry humor, yet behind that was meaning. Jane\n",
       "blushed and made arch eyes at him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Take care, Lassiter, I might think that a proposal,” she replied,\n",
       "gaily. “It's dangerous to propose elopement to a Mormon woman. Well,\n",
       "I was expecting you. Now will be a good hour to show you Milly Erne's\n",
       "grave. The day-riders have gone, and the night-riders haven't come in.\n",
       "Bern, what do you make of that? Need I worry? You know I have to be made\n",
       "to worry.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, it's not usual for the night shift to ride in so late,” replied\n",
       "Venters, slowly, and his glance sought Lassiter's. “Cattle are usually\n",
       "quiet after dark. Still, I've known even a coyote to stampede your white\n",
       "herd.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I refuse to borrow trouble. Come,” said Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "They mounted, and, with Jane in the lead, rode down the lane, and,\n",
       "turning off into a cattle trail, proceeded westward. Venters's dogs\n",
       "trotted behind them. On this side of the ranch the outlook was different\n",
       "from that on the other; the immediate foreground was rough and the sage\n",
       "more rugged and less colorful; there were no dark-blue lines of canyons\n",
       "to hold the eye, nor any uprearing rock walls. It was a long roll and\n",
       "slope into gray obscurity. Soon Jane left the trail and rode into the\n",
       "sage, and presently she dismounted and threw her bridle. The men did\n",
       "likewise. Then, on foot, they followed her, coming out at length on the\n",
       "rim of a low escarpment. She passed by several little ridges of earth to\n",
       "halt before a faintly defined mound. It lay in the shade of a sweeping\n",
       "sage-brush close to the edge of the promontory; and a rider could have\n",
       "jumped his horse over it without recognizing a grave.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Here!”\n",
       "\n",
       "She looked sad as she spoke, but she offered no explanation for the\n",
       "neglect of an unmarked, uncared-for grave. There was a little bunch of\n",
       "pale, sweet lavender daisies, doubtless planted there by Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I only come here to remember and to pray,” she said. “But I leave no\n",
       "trail!”\n",
       "\n",
       "A grave in the sage! How lonely this resting-place of Milly Erne! The\n",
       "cottonwoods or the alfalfa fields were not in sight, nor was there any\n",
       "rock or ridge or cedar to lend contrast to the monotony. Gray slopes,\n",
       "tinging the purple, barren and wild, with the wind waving the sage,\n",
       "swept away to the dim horizon.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter looked at the grave and then out into space. At that moment he\n",
       "seemed a figure of bronze.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane touched Venters's arm and led him back to the horses.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern!” cried Jane, when they were out of hearing. “Suppose Lassiter\n",
       "were Milly's husband--the father of that little girl lost so long ago!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“It might be, Jane. Let us ride on. If he wants to see us again he'll\n",
       "come.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So they mounted and rode out to the cattle trail and began to climb.\n",
       "From the height of the ridge, where they had started down, Venters\n",
       "looked back. He did not see Lassiter, but his glance, drawn irresistibly\n",
       "farther out on the gradual slope, caught sight of a moving cloud of\n",
       "dust.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hello, a rider!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes, I see,” said Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That fellow's riding hard. Jane, there's something wrong.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh yes, there must be.... How he rides!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The horse disappeared in the sage, and then puffs of dust marked his\n",
       "course.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He's short-cut on us--he's making straight for the corrals.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters and Jane galloped their steeds and reined in at the turning of\n",
       "the lane. This lane led down to the right of the grove. Suddenly into\n",
       "its lower entrance flashed a bay horse. Then Venters caught the fast\n",
       "rhythmic beat of pounding hoofs. Soon his keen eye recognized the swing\n",
       "of the rider in his saddle.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's Judkins, your Gentile rider!” he cried. “Jane, when Judkins rides\n",

       "The rider thundered up and almost threw his foam-flecked horse in the\n",
       "sudden stop. He was a giant form, and with fearless eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Judkins, you're all bloody!” cried Jane, in affright. “Oh, you've been\n",
       "shot!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nothin' much Miss Withersteen. I got a nick in the shoulder. I'm some\n",

       "“Jud, they meant to kill you,” declared Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Now I wonder,” returned Judkins. “They wanted me bad. An' it ain't\n",
       "regular for rustlers to waste time chasin' one rider.”\n",

       "as the leader of Jane Withersteen's riders. Wrangle pulled hard on a\n",
       "tight rein. He galloped out of the lane, down the shady border of\n",
       "the grove, and hauled up at the watering-trough, where he pranced and\n",
       "champed his bit. Venters got off and filled his canteen while the horse\n",

       "told Venters that there was neither man nor horse nor steer within the\n",
       "limit of his vision, unless they were lying down in the sage. Ring loped\n",
       "in the lead and Whitie loped in the rear. Wrangle settled gradually into\n",
       "an easy swinging canter, and Venters's thoughts, now that the rush and\n",
       "flurry of the start were past, and the long miles stretched before him,\n",
       "reverted to a calm reckoning of late singular coincidences.\n",

       "There was the night ride of Tull's, which, viewed in the light of\n",

       "employ, an intention frustrated, no doubt, only by Judkin's magnificent\n",
       "riding of her racer, and lastly the driving of the red herd. These\n",
       "events, to Venters's color of mind, had a dark relationship. Remembering\n",
       "Jane's accusation of bitterness, he tried hard to put aside his rancor\n",
       "in judging Tull. But it was bitter knowledge that made him see the\n",
       "truth. He had felt the shadow of an unseen hand; he had watched till he\n",
       "saw its dim outline, and then he had traced it to a man's hate, to\n",
       "the rivalry of a Mormon Elder, to the power of a Bishop, to the long,\n",
       "far-reaching arm of a terrible creed. That unseen hand had made its\n",
       "first move against Jane Withersteen. Her riders had been called in,\n",
       "leaving her without help to drive seven thousand head of cattle. But to\n",
       "Venters it seemed extraordinary that the power which had called in these\n",
       "riders had left so many cattle to be driven by rustlers and harried by\n",
       "wolves. For hand in glove with that power was an insatiate greed; they\n",
       "were one and the same.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What can Oldring do with twenty-five hundred head of cattle?” muttered\n",
       "Venters. “Is he a Mormon? Did he meet Tull last night? It looks like\n",

       "\n",
       "Wrangle did the twenty-five miles in three hours and walked little of\n",

       "own gait. The afternoon had well advanced when Venters struck the trail\n",
       "of the red herd and found where it had grazed the night before. Then\n",
       "Venters rested the horse and used his eyes. Near at hand were a cow\n",
       "and a calf and several yearlings, and farther out in the sage some\n",
       "straggling steers. He caught a glimpse of coyotes skulking near the\n",
       "cattle. The slow sweeping gaze of the rider failed to find other living\n",
       "things within the field of sight. The sage about him was breast-high to\n",
       "his horse, oversweet with its warm, fragrant breath, gray where it\n",
       "waved to the light, darker where the wind left it still, and beyond the\n",
       "wonderful haze-purple lent by distance. Far across that wide waste began\n",
       "the slow lift of uplands through which Deception Pass cut its tortuous\n",
       "many-canyoned way.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters raised the bridle of his horse and followed the broad cattle\n",
       "trail. The crushed sage resembled the path of a monster snake. In a few\n",
       "miles of travel he passed several cows and calves that had escaped the\n",
       "drive. Then he stood on the last high bench of the slope with the floor\n",
       "of the valley beneath. The opening of the canyon showed in a break of\n",
       "the sage, and the cattle trail paralleled it as far as he could see.\n",
       "That trail led to an undiscovered point where Oldring drove cattle\n",
       "into the pass, and many a rider who had followed it had never returned.\n",
       "Venters satisfied himself that the rustlers had not deviated from their\n",
       "usual course, and then he turned at right angles off the cattle trail\n",
       "and made for the head of the pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sun lost its heat and wore down to the western horizon, where it\n",
       "changed from white to gold and rested like a huge ball about to roll on\n",
       "its golden shadows down the slope. Venters watched the lengthening of\n",
       "the rays and bars, and marveled at his own league-long shadow. The sun\n",
       "sank. There was instant shading of brightness about him, and he saw a\n",
       "kind of cold purple bloom creep ahead of him to cross the canyon, to\n",
       "mount the opposite slope and chase and darken and bury the last golden\n",
       "flare of sunlight.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters rode into a trail that he always took to get down into the\n",
       "canyon. He dismounted and found no tracks but his own made days\n",
       "previous. Nevertheless he sent the dog Ring ahead and waited. In a\n",
       "little while Ring returned. Whereupon Venters led his horse on to the\n",
       "break in the ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "The opening into Deception Pass was one of the remarkable natural\n",
       "phenomena in a country remarkable for vast slopes of sage, uplands\n",
       "insulated by gigantic red walls, and deep canyons of mysterious source\n",
       "and outlet. Here the valley floor was level, and here opened a narrow\n",
       "chasm, a ragged vent in yellow walls of stone. The trail down the five\n",
       "hundred feet of sheer depth always tested Venters's nerve. It was\n",
       "bad going for even a burro. But Wrangle, as Venters led him, snorted\n",
       "defiance or disgust rather than fear, and, like a hobbled horse on the\n",
       "jump, lifted his ponderous iron-shod fore hoofs and crashed down over\n",
       "the first rough step. Venters warmed to greater admiration of the\n",
       "sorrel; and, giving him a loose bridle, he stepped down foot by foot.\n",
       "Oftentimes the stones and shale started by Wrangle buried Venters to\n",
       "his knees; again he was hard put to it to dodge a rolling boulder, there\n",
       "were times when he could not see Wrangle for dust, and once he and the\n",
       "horse rode a sliding shelf of yellow, weathered cliff. It was a trail\n",
       "on which there could be no stops, and, therefore, if perilous, it was at\n",
       "least one that did not take long in the descent.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters breathed lighter when that was over, and felt a sudden assurance\n",
       "in the success of his enterprise. For at first it had been a reckless\n",
       "determination to achieve something at any cost, and now it resolved\n",
       "itself into an adventure worthy of all his reason and cunning, and\n",
       "keenness of eye and ear.\n",
       "\n",
       "Pinyon pines clustered in little clumps along the level floor of the\n",
       "pass. Twilight had gathered under the walls. Venters rode into the trail\n",
       "and up the canyon. Gradually the trees and caves and objects low down\n",
       "turned black, and this blackness moved up the walls till night enfolded\n",
       "the pass, while day still lingered above. The sky darkened; and stars\n",
       "began to show, at first pale and then bright. Sharp notches of the\n",
       "rim-wall, biting like teeth into the blue, were landmarks by which\n",
       "Venters knew where his camping site lay. He had to feel his way through\n",
       "a thicket of slender oaks to a spring where he watered Wrangle and drank\n",
       "himself. Here he unsaddled and turned Wrangle loose, having no fear that\n",
       "the horse would leave the thick, cool grass adjacent to the spring. Next\n",
       "he satisfied his own hunger, fed Ring and Whitie and, with them curled\n",
       "beside him, composed himself to await sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "There had been a time when night in the high altitude of these Utah\n",
       "uplands had been satisfying to Venters. But that was before the\n",
       "oppression of enemies had made the change in his mind. As a rider\n",
       "guarding the herd he had never thought of the night's wildness and\n",
       "loneliness; as an outcast, now when the full silence set in, and the\n",
       "deep darkness, and trains of radiant stars shone cold and calm, he\n",
       "lay with an ache in his heart. For a year he had lived as a black fox,\n",
       "driven from his kind. He longed for the sound of a voice, the touch of\n",
       "a hand. In the daytime there was riding from place to place, and the\n",
       "gun practice to which something drove him, and other tasks that at least\n",
       "necessitated action, at night, before he won sleep, there was strife in\n",
       "his soul. He yearned to leave the endless sage slopes, the wilderness\n",
       "of canyons, and it was in the lonely night that this yearning grew\n",
       "unbearable. It was then that he reached forth to feel Ring or Whitie,\n",
       "immeasurably grateful for the love and companionship of two dogs.\n",
       "\n",
       "On this night the same old loneliness beset Venters, the old habit\n",
       "of sad thought and burning unquiet had its way. But from it evolved a\n",
       "conviction that his useless life had undergone a subtle change. He had\n",
       "sensed it first when Wrangle swung him up to the high saddle, he knew\n",
       "it now when he lay in the gateway of Deception Pass. He had no thrill of\n",
       "adventure, rather a gloomy perception of great hazard, perhaps death. He\n",
       "meant to find Oldring's retreat. The rustlers had fast horses, but none\n",
       "that could catch Wrangle. Venters knew no rustler could creep upon him\n",
       "at night when Ring and Whitie guarded his hiding-place. For the rest, he\n",
       "had eyes and ears, and a long rifle and an unerring aim, which he meant\n",
       "to use. Strangely his foreshadowing of change did not hold a thought\n",
       "of the killing of Tull. It related only to what was to happen to him in\n",
       "Deception Pass; and he could no more lift the veil of that mystery than\n",
       "tell where the trails led to in that unexplored canyon. Moreover, he did\n",
       "not care. And at length, tired out by stress of thought, he fell asleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "When his eyes unclosed, day had come again, and he saw the rim of the\n",
       "opposite wall tipped with the gold of sunrise. A few moments sufficed\n",
       "for the morning's simple camp duties. Near at hand he found Wrangle,\n",
       "and to his surprise the horse came to him. Wrangle was one of the horses\n",
       "that left his viciousness in the home corral. What he wanted was to be\n",
       "free of mules and burros and steers, to roll in dust-patches, and then\n",
       "to run down the wide, open, windy sage-plains, and at night browse and\n",
       "sleep in the cool wet grass of a springhole. Jerd knew the sorrel when\n",
       "he said of him, “Wait till he smells the sage!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters saddled and led him out of the oak thicket, and, leaping\n",
       "astride, rode up the canyon, with Ring and Whitie trotting behind. An\n",
       "old grass-grown trail followed the course of a shallow wash where flowed\n",
       "a thin stream of water. The canyon was a hundred rods wide, its yellow\n",
       "walls were perpendicular; it had abundant sage and a scant growth of oak\n",
       "and pinon. For five miles it held to a comparatively straight bearing,\n",
       "and then began a heightening of rugged walls and a deepening of the\n",
       "floor. Beyond this point of sudden change in the character of the\n",
       "canyon Venters had never explored, and here was the real door to the\n",
       "intricacies of Deception Pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "He reined Wrangle to a walk, halted now and then to listen, and then\n",
       "proceeded cautiously with shifting and alert gaze. The canyon assumed\n",
       "proportions that dwarfed those of its first ten miles. Venters rode on\n",
       "and on, not losing in the interest of his wide surroundings any of his\n",
       "caution or keen search for tracks or sight of living thing. If there\n",
       "ever had been a trail here, he could not find it. He rode through sage\n",
       "and clumps of pinon trees and grassy plots where long-petaled purple\n",
       "lilies bloomed. He rode through a dark constriction of the pass no wider\n",
       "than the lane in the grove at Cottonwoods. And he came out into a great\n",
       "amphitheater into which jutted huge towering corners of a confluence of\n",
       "intersecting canyons.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters sat his horse, and, with a rider's eye, studied this wild\n",
       "cross-cut of huge stone gullies. Then he went on, guided by the course\n",
       "of running water. If it had not been for the main stream of water\n",
       "flowing north he would never have been able to tell which of those many\n",
       "openings was a continuation of the pass. In crossing this amphitheater\n",
       "he went by the mouths of five canyons, fording little streams that\n",
       "flowed into the larger one. Gaining the outlet which he took to be the\n",
       "pass, he rode on again under over hanging walls. One side was dark in\n",
       "shade, the other light in sun. This narrow passageway turned and twisted\n",
       "and opened into a valley that amazed Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here again was a sweep of purple sage, richer than upon the higher\n",
       "levels. The valley was miles long, several wide, and inclosed by\n",
       "unscalable walls. But it was the background of this valley that so\n",
       "forcibly struck him. Across the sage-flat rose a strange up-flinging of\n",
       "yellow rocks. He could not tell which were close and which were distant.\n",
       "Scrawled mounds of stone, like mountain waves, seemed to roll up to\n",
       "steep bare slopes and towers.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this plain of sage Venters flushed birds and rabbits, and when he had\n",
       "proceeded about a mile he caught sight of the bobbing white tails of\n",
       "a herd of running antelope. He rode along the edge of the stream which\n",
       "wound toward the western end of the slowly looming mounds of stone.\n",
       "The high slope retreated out of sight behind the nearer protection.\n",
       "To Venters the valley appeared to have been filled in by a mountain of\n",
       "melted stone that had hardened in strange shapes of rounded outline.\n",
       "He followed the stream till he lost it in a deep cut. Therefore Venters\n",
       "quit the dark slit which baffled further search in that direction, and\n",
       "rode out along the curved edge of stone where it met the sage. It was\n",
       "not long before he came to a low place, and here Wrangle readily climbed\n",
       "up.\n",
       "\n",
       "All about him was ridgy roll of wind-smoothed, rain-washed rock. Not a\n",
       "tuft of grass or a bunch of sage colored the dull rust-yellow. He saw\n",
       "where, to the right, this uneven flow of stone ended in a blunt wall.\n",
       "Leftward, from the hollow that lay at his feet, mounted a gradual\n",
       "slow-swelling slope to a great height topped by leaning, cracked,\n",
       "and ruined crags. Not for some time did he grasp the wonder of that\n",
       "acclivity. It was no less than a mountain-side, glistening in the sun\n",
       "like polished granite, with cedar-trees springing as if by magic out of\n",
       "the denuded surface. Winds had swept it clear of weathered shale, and\n",
       "rains had washed it free of dust. Far up the curved slope its beautiful\n",
       "lines broke to meet the vertical rim-wall, to lose its grace in a\n",
       "different order and color of rock, a stained yellow cliff of cracks and\n",
       "caves and seamed crags. And straight before Venters was a scene less\n",
       "striking but more significant to his keen survey. For beyond a mile\n",
       "of the bare, hummocky rock began the valley of sage, and the mouths of\n",
       "canyons, one of which surely was another gateway into the pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "He got off his horse, and, giving the bridle to Ring to hold, he\n",
       "commenced a search for the cleft where the stream ran. He was not\n",
       "successful and concluded the water dropped into an underground passage.\n",
       "Then he returned to where he had left Wrangle, and led him down off the\n",
       "stone to the sage. It was a short ride to the opening canyons. There was\n",
       "no reason for a choice of which one to enter. The one he rode into was a\n",
       "clear, sharp shaft in yellow stone a thousand feet deep, with wonderful\n",
       "wind-worn caves low down and high above buttressed and turreted\n",
       "ramparts. Farther on Venters came into a region where deep indentations\n",
       "marked the line of canyon walls. These were huge, cove-like blind\n",
       "pockets extending back to a sharp corner with a dense growth of\n",
       "underbrush and trees.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters penetrated into one of these offshoots, and, as he had hoped, he\n",
       "found abundant grass. He had to bend the oak saplings to get his horse\n",
       "through. Deciding to make this a hiding-place if he could find water, he\n",
       "worked back to the limit of the shelving walls. In a little cluster of\n",
       "silver spruces he found a spring. This inclosed nook seemed an ideal\n",
       "place to leave his horse and to camp at night, and from which to make\n",
       "stealthy trips on foot. The thick grass hid his trail; the dense growth\n",
       "of oaks in the opening would serve as a barrier to keep Wrangle in, if,\n",
       "indeed, the luxuriant browse would not suffice for that. So Venters,\n",
       "leaving Whitie with the horse, called Ring to his side, and, rifle in\n",
       "hand, worked his way out to the open. A careful photographing in mind\n",
       "of the formation of the bold outlines of rimrock assured him he would be\n",
       "able to return to his retreat even in the dark.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bunches of scattered sage covered the center of the canyon, and among\n",
       "these Venters threaded his way with the step of an Indian. At intervals\n",
       "he put his hand on the dog and stopped to listen. There was a drowsy\n",
       "hum of insects, but no other sound disturbed the warm midday stillness.\n",
       "Venters saw ahead a turn, more abrupt than any yet. Warily he rounded\n",
       "this corner, once again to halt bewildered.\n",
       "\n",
       "The canyon opened fan-shaped into a great oval of green and gray\n",
       "growths. It was the hub of an oblong wheel, and from it, at regular\n",
       "distances, like spokes, ran the outgoing canyons. Here a dull red color\n",
       "predominated over the fading yellow. The corners of wall bluntly rose,\n",
       "scarred and scrawled, to taper into towers and serrated peaks and\n",
       "pinnacled domes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters pushed on more heedfully than ever. Toward the center of this\n",
       "circle the sage-brush grew smaller and farther apart He was about to\n",
       "sheer off to the right, where thickets and jumbles of fallen rock would\n",
       "afford him cover, when he ran right upon a broad cattle trail. Like a\n",
       "road it was, more than a trail, and the cattle tracks were fresh. What\n",
       "surprised him more, they were wet! He pondered over this feature. It\n",
       "had not rained. The only solution to this puzzle was that the cattle had\n",
       "been driven through water, and water deep enough to wet their legs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Suddenly Ring growled low. Venters rose cautiously and looked over the\n",
       "sage. A band of straggling horsemen were riding across the oval. He\n",
       "sank down, startled and trembling. “Rustlers!” he muttered. Hurriedly\n",
       "he glanced about for a place to hide. Near at hand there was\n",
       "nothing but sage-brush. He dared not risk crossing the open\n",
       "patches to reach the rocks. Again he peeped over the sage. The\n",
       "rustlers--four--five--seven--eight in all, were approaching, but not\n",
       "directly in line with him. That was relief for a cold deadness which\n",
       "seemed to be creeping inward along his veins. He crouched down with\n",
       "bated breath and held the bristling dog.\n",
       "\n",
       "He heard the click of iron-shod hoofs on stone, the coarse laughter of\n",
       "men, and then voices gradually dying away. Long moments passed. Then he\n",
       "rose. The rustlers were riding into a canyon. Their horses were tired,\n",
       "and they had several pack animals; evidently they had traveled far.\n",
       "Venters doubted that they were the rustlers who had driven the red herd.\n",
       "Olding's band had split. Venters watched these horsemen disappear under\n",
       "a bold canyon wall.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rustlers had come from the northwest side of the oval. Venters kept\n",
       "a steady gaze in that direction, hoping, if there were more, to see\n",
       "from what canyon they rode. A quarter of an hour went by. Reward for his\n",
       "vigilance came when he descried three more mounted men, far over to the\n",
       "north. But out of what canyon they had ridden it was too late to tell.\n",
       "He watched the three ride across the oval and round the jutting red\n",
       "corner where the others had gone.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Up that canyon!” exclaimed Venters. “Oldring's den! I've found it!”\n",
       "\n",
       "A knotty point for Venters was the fact that the cattle tracks all\n",
       "pointed west. The broad trail came from the direction of the canyon\n",
       "into which the rustlers had ridden, and undoubtedly the cattle had been\n",
       "driven out of it across the oval. There were no tracks pointing the\n",
       "other way. It had been in his mind that Oldring had driven the red herd\n",
       "toward the rendezvous, and not from it. Where did that broad trail come\n",
       "down into the pass, and where did it lead? Venters knew he wasted\n",
       "time in pondering the question, but it held a fascination not easily\n",
       "dispelled. For many years Oldring's mysterious entrance and exit to\n",
       "Deception Pass had been all-absorbing topics to sage-riders.\n",
       "\n",
       "All at once the dog put an end to Venters's pondering. Ring sniffed the\n",
       "air, turned slowly in his tracks with a whine, and then growled. Venters\n",
       "wheeled. Two horsemen were within a hundred yards, coming straight at\n",
       "him. One, lagging behind the other, was Oldring's Masked Rider.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters cunningly sank, slowly trying to merge into sage-brush. But,\n",
       "guarded as his action was, the first horse detected it. He stopped\n",
       "short, snorted, and shot up his ears. The rustler bent forward, as if\n",
       "keenly peering ahead. Then, with a swift sweep, he jerked a gun from its\n",
       "sheath and fired.\n",
       "\n",
       "The bullet zipped through the sage-brush. Flying bits of wood struck\n",
       "Venters, and the hot, stinging pain seemed to lift him in one leap.\n",
       "Like a flash the blue barrel of his rifle gleamed level and he shot\n",
       "once--twice.\n",
       "\n",
       "The foremost rustler dropped his weapon and toppled from his saddle, to\n",
       "fall with his foot catching in a stirrup. The horse snorted wildly and\n",
       "plunged away, dragging the rustler through the sage.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Masked Rider huddled over his pommel slowly swaying to one side, and\n",
       "then, with a faint, strange cry, slipped out of the saddle.\n",

       "\n",
       "Venters looked quickly from the fallen rustlers to the canyon where the\n",
       "others had disappeared. He calculated on the time needed for running\n",
       "horses to return to the open, if their riders heard shots. He waited\n",
       "breathlessly. But the estimated time dragged by and no riders appeared.\n",
       "Venters began presently to believe that the rifle reports had not\n",
       "penetrated into the recesses of the canyon, and felt safe for the\n",
       "immediate present.\n",
       "\n",
       "He hurried to the spot where the first rustler had been dragged by his\n",
       "horse. The man lay in deep grass, dead, jaw fallen, eyes protruding--a\n",
       "sight that sickened Venters. The first man at whom he had ever aimed a\n",
       "weapon he had shot through the heart. With the clammy sweat oozing\n",
       "from every pore Venters dragged the rustler in among some boulders and\n",
       "covered him with slabs of rock. Then he smoothed out the crushed trail\n",
       "in grass and sage. The rustler's horse had stopped a quarter of a mile\n",
       "off and was grazing.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Venters rapidly strode toward the Masked Rider not even the cold\n",
       "nausea that gripped him could wholly banish curiosity. For he had shot\n",
       "Oldring's infamous lieutenant, whose face had never been seen. Venters\n",
       "experienced a grim pride in the feat. What would Tull say to this\n",
       "achievement of the outcast who rode too often to Deception Pass?\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters's curious eagerness and expectation had not prepared him for the\n",
       "shock he received when he stood over a slight, dark figure. The rustler\n",
       "wore the black mask that had given him his name, but he had no weapons.\n",
       "Venters glanced at the drooping horse, there were no gun-sheaths on the\n",
       "saddle.\n",
       "\n",
       "“A rustler who didn't pack guns!” muttered Venters. “He wears no belt.\n",
       "He couldn't pack guns in that rig.... Strange!”\n",
       "\n",
       "A low, gasping intake of breath and a sudden twitching of body told\n",
       "Venters the rider still lived.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He's alive!... I've got to stand here and watch him die. And I shot an\n",
       "unarmed man.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Shrinkingly Venters removed the rider's wide sombrero and the black\n",
       "cloth mask. This action disclosed bright chestnut hair, inclined to\n",
       "curl, and a white, youthful face. Along the lower line of cheek and jaw\n",
       "was a clear demarcation, where the brown of tanned skin met the white\n",
       "that had been hidden from the sun.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, he's only a boy!... What! Can he be Oldring's Masked Rider?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The boy showed signs of returning consciousness. He stirred; his lips\n",
       "moved; a small brown hand clenched in his blouse.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters knelt with a gathering horror of his deed. His bullet had\n",
       "entered the rider's right breast, high up to the shoulder. With hands\n",
       "that shook, Venters untied a black scarf and ripped open the blood-wet\n",
       "blouse.\n",
       "\n",
       "First he saw a gaping hole, dark red against a whiteness of skin, from\n",
       "which welled a slender red stream. Then the graceful, beautiful swell of\n",
       "a woman's breast!\n",
       "\n",
       "“A woman!” he cried. “A girl!... I've killed a girl!”\n",
       "\n",
       "She suddenly opened eyes that transfixed Venters. They were fathomless\n",
       "blue. Consciousness of death was there, a blended terror and pain, but\n",
       "no consciousness of sight. She did not see Venters. She stared into the\n",
       "unknown.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then came a spasm of vitality. She writhed in a torture of reviving\n",
       "strength, and in her convulsions she almost tore from Ventner's grasp.\n",
       "Slowly she relaxed and sank partly back. The ungloved hand sought the\n",
       "wound, and pressed so hard that her wrist half buried itself in her\n",
       "bosom. Blood trickled between her spread fingers. And she looked at\n",
       "Venters with eyes that saw him.\n",
       "\n",
       "He cursed himself and the unerring aim of which he had been so proud. He\n",
       "had seen that look in the eyes of a crippled antelope which he was\n",
       "about to finish with his knife. But in her it had infinitely more--a\n",
       "revelation of mortal spirit. The instinctive bringing to life was\n",
       "there, and the divining helplessness and the terrible accusation of the\n",
       "stricken.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Forgive me! I didn't know!” burst out Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You shot me--you've killed me!” she whispered, in panting gasps. Upon\n",
       "her lips appeared a fluttering, bloody froth. By that Venters knew\n",
       "the air in her lungs was mixing with blood. “Oh, I knew--it\n",
       "would--come--some day!... Oh, the burn!... Hold me--I'm sinking--it's all\n",
       "dark.... Ah, God!... Mercy--”\n",
       "\n",
       "Her rigidity loosened in one long quiver and she lay back limp, still,\n",
       "white as snow, with closed eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters thought then that she died. But the faint pulsation of her\n",
       "breast assured him that life yet lingered. Death seemed only a matter\n",
       "of moments, for the bullet had gone clear through her. Nevertheless, he\n",
       "tore sageleaves from a bush, and, pressing them tightly over her wounds,\n",
       "he bound the black scarf round her shoulder, tying it securely under\n",
       "her arm. Then he closed the blouse, hiding from his sight that\n",
       "blood-stained, accusing breast.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What--now?” he questioned, with flying mind. “I must get out of here.\n",
       "She's dying--but I can't leave her.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He rapidly surveyed the sage to the north and made out no animate\n",
       "object. Then he picked up the girl's sombrero and the mask. This time\n",
       "the mask gave him as great a shock as when he first removed it from\n",
       "her face. For in the woman he had forgotten the rustler, and this black\n",
       "strip of felt-cloth established the identity of Oldring's Masked Rider.\n",
       "Venters had solved the mystery. He slipped his rifle under her, and,\n",
       "lifting her carefully upon it, he began to retrace his steps. The\n",
       "dog trailed in his shadow. And the horse, that had stood drooping by,\n",
       "followed without a call. Venters chose the deepest tufts of grass and\n",
       "clumps of sage on his return. From time to time he glanced over his\n",
       "shoulder. He did not rest. His concern was to avoid jarring the girl and\n",
       "to hide his trail. Gaining the narrow canyon, he turned and held close\n",
       "to the wall till he reached his hiding-place. When he entered the dense\n",
       "thicket of oaks he was hard put to it to force a way through. But he\n",
       "held his burden almost upright, and by slipping side wise and bending\n",
       "the saplings he got in. Through sage and grass he hurried to the grove\n",
       "of silver spruces.\n",
       "\n",
       "He laid the girl down, almost fearing to look at her. Though marble pale\n",
       "and cold, she was living. Venters then appreciated the tax that long\n",
       "carry had been to his strength. He sat down to rest. Whitie sniffed at\n",
       "the pale girl and whined and crept to Venters's feet. Ring lapped the\n",
       "water in the runway of the spring.\n",
       "\n",
       "Presently Venters went out to the opening, caught the horse and, leading\n",
       "him through the thicket, unsaddled him and tied him with a long halter.\n",
       "Wrangle left his browsing long enough to whinny and toss his head.\n",
       "Venters felt that he could not rest easily till he had secured the other\n",
       "rustler's horse; so, taking his rifle and calling for Ring, he set out.\n",
       "Swiftly yet watchfully he made his way through the canyon to the oval\n",
       "and out to the cattle trail. What few tracks might have betrayed him\n",
       "he obliterated, so only an expert tracker could have trailed him. Then,\n",
       "with many a wary backward glance across the sage, he started to round\n",
       "up the rustler's horse. This was unexpectedly easy. He led the horse to\n",
       "lower ground, out of sight from the opposite side of the oval along the\n",
       "shadowy western wall, and so on into his canyon and secluded camp.\n",
       "\n",
       "The girl's eyes were open; a feverish spot burned in her cheeks she\n",
       "moaned something unintelligible to Venters, but he took the movement of\n",
       "her lips to mean that she wanted water. Lifting her head, he tipped the\n",
       "canteen to her lips. After that she again lapsed into unconsciousness or\n",
       "a weakness which was its counterpart. Venters noted, however, that the\n",
       "burning flush had faded into the former pallor.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sun set behind the high canyon rim, and a cool shade darkened the\n",
       "walls. Venters fed the dogs and put a halter on the dead rustlers horse.\n",
       "He allowed Wrangle to browse free. This done, he cut spruce boughs and\n",
       "made a lean-to for the girl. Then, gently lifting her upon a blanket,\n",
       "he folded the sides over her. The other blanket he wrapped about his\n",
       "shoulders and found a comfortable seat against a spruce-tree that upheld\n",
       "the little shack. Ring and Whitie lay near at hand, one asleep, the\n",
       "other watchful.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters dreaded the night's vigil. At night his mind was active, and\n",
       "this time he had to watch and think and feel beside a dying girl whom\n",
       "he had all but murdered. A thousand excuses he invented for himself, yet\n",
       "not one made any difference in his act or his self-reproach.\n",
       "\n",
       "It seemed to him that when night fell black he could see her white face\n",
       "so much more plainly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“She'll go, presently,” he said, “and be out of agony--thank God!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Every little while certainty of her death came to him with a shock; and\n",
       "then he would bend over and lay his ear on her breast. Her heart still\n",
       "beat.\n",
       "\n",
       "The early night blackness cleared to the cold starlight. The horses were\n",
       "not moving, and no sound disturbed the deathly silence of the canyon.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'll bury her here,” thought Venters, “and let her grave be as much a\n",
       "mystery as her life was.”\n",
       "\n",
       "For the girl's few words, the look of her eyes, the prayer, had\n",
       "strangely touched Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“She was only a girl,” he soliloquized. “What was she to Oldring?\n",
       "Rustlers don't have wives nor sisters nor daughters. She was bad--that's\n",
       "all. But somehow... well, she may not have willingly become the companion\n",
       "of rustlers. That prayer of hers to God for mercy!... Life is strange\n",
       "and cruel. I wonder if other members of Oldring's gang are women? Likely\n",
       "enough. But what was his game? Oldring's Mask Rider! A name to make\n",
       "villagers hide and lock their doors. A name credited with a dozen\n",
       "murders, a hundred forays, and a thousand stealings of cattle. What\n",
       "part did the girl have in this? It may have served Oldring to create\n",
       "mystery.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Hours passed. The white stars moved across the narrow strip of dark-blue\n",
       "sky above. The silence awoke to the low hum of insects. Venters watched\n",
       "the immovable white face, and as he watched, hour by hour waiting for\n",
       "death, the infamy of her passed from his mind. He thought only of the\n",
       "sadness, the truth of the moment. Whoever she was--whatever she had\n",
       "done--she was young and she was dying.\n",
       "\n",
       "The after-part of the night wore on interminably. The starlight failed\n",
       "and the gloom blackened to the darkest hour. “She'll die at the gray\n",
       "of dawn,” muttered Venters, remembering some old woman's fancy. The\n",
       "blackness paled to gray, and the gray lightened and day peeped over\n",
       "the eastern rim. Venters listened at the breast of the girl. She\n",
       "still lived. Did he only imagine that her heart beat stronger, ever so\n",
       "slightly, but stronger? He pressed his ear closer to her breast. And he\n",
       "rose with his own pulse quickening.\n",
       "\n",
       "“If she doesn't die soon--she's got a chance--the barest chance to\n",
       "live,” he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "He wondered if the internal bleeding had ceased. There was no more film\n",
       "of blood upon her lips. But no corpse could have been whiter. Opening\n",
       "her blouse, he untied the scarf, and carefully picked away the sage\n",
       "leaves from the wound in her shoulder. It had closed. Lifting her\n",
       "lightly, he ascertained that the same was true of the hole where the\n",
       "bullet had come out. He reflected on the fact that clean wounds closed\n",
       "quickly in the healing upland air. He recalled instances of riders who\n",
       "had been cut and shot apparently to fatal issues; yet the blood had\n",
       "clotted, the wounds closed, and they had recovered. He had no way to\n",
       "tell if internal hemorrhage still went on, but he believed that it had\n",
       "stopped. Otherwise she would surely not have lived so long. He marked\n",
       "the entrance of the bullet, and concluded that it had just touched the\n",
       "upper lobe of her lung. Perhaps the wound in the lung had also closed.\n",
       "As he began to wash the blood stains from her breast and carefully\n",
       "rebandage the wound, he was vaguely conscious of a strange, grave\n",
       "happiness in the thought that she might live.\n",
       "\n",
       "Broad daylight and a hint of sunshine high on the cliff-rim to the west\n",
       "brought him to consideration of what he had better do. And while busy\n",
       "with his few camp tasks he revolved the thing in his mind. It would not\n",
       "be wise for him to remain long in his present hiding-place. And if he\n",
       "intended to follow the cattle trail and try to find the rustlers he had\n",
       "better make a move at once. For he knew that rustlers, being riders,\n",
       "would not make much of a day's or night's absence from camp for one\n",
       "or two of their number; but when the missing ones failed to show up in\n",
       "reasonable time there would be a search. And Venters was afraid of that.\n",
       "\n",
       "“A good tracker could trail me,” he muttered. “And I'd be cornered here.\n",
       "Let's see. Rustlers are a lazy set when they're not on the ride. I'll\n",
       "risk it. Then I'll change my hiding-place.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He carefully cleaned and reloaded his guns. When he rose to go he bent\n",
       "a long glance down upon the unconscious girl. Then ordering Whitie and\n",
       "Ring to keep guard, he left the camp.\n",
       "\n",
       "The safest cover lay close under the wall of the canyon, and here\n",
       "through the dense thickets Venters made his slow, listening advance\n",
       "toward the oval. Upon gaining the wide opening he decided to cross it\n",
       "and follow the left wall till he came to the cattle trail. He scanned\n",
       "the oval as keenly as if hunting for antelope. Then, stooping, he stole\n",
       "from one cover to another, taking advantage of rocks and bunches of\n",
       "sage, until he had reached the thickets under the opposite wall. Once\n",
       "there, he exercised extreme caution in his surveys of the ground ahead,\n",
       "but increased his speed when moving. Dodging from bush to bush, he\n",
       "passed the mouths of two canyons, and in the entrance of a third canyon\n",
       "he crossed a wash of swift clear water, to come abruptly upon the cattle\n",
       "trail.\n",
       "\n",
       "It followed the low bank of the wash, and, keeping it in sight, Venters\n",
       "hugged the line of sage and thicket. Like the curves of a serpent the\n",
       "canyon wound for a mile or more and then opened into a valley. Patches\n",
       "of red showed clear against the purple of sage, and farther out on the\n",
       "level dotted strings of red led away to the wall of rock.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ha, the red herd!” exclaimed Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then dots of white and black told him there were cattle of other colors\n",
       "in this inclosed valley. Oldring, the rustler, was also a rancher.\n",
       "Venters's calculating eye took count of stock that outnumbered the red\n",
       "herd.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What a range!” went on Venters. “Water and grass enough for fifty\n",
       "thousand head, and no riders needed!”\n",
       "\n",
       "After his first burst of surprise and rapid calculation Venters lost no\n",
       "time there, but slunk again into the sage on his back trail. With the\n",
       "discovery of Oldring's hidden cattle-range had come enlightenment\n",
       "on several problems. Here the rustler kept his stock, here was Jane\n",
       "Withersteen's red herd; here were the few cattle that had disappeared\n",
       "from the Cottonwoods slopes during the last two years. Until Oldring had\n",
       "driven the red herd his thefts of cattle for that time had not been\n",
       "more than enough to supply meat for his men. Of late no drives had been\n",
       "reported from Sterling or the villages north. And Venters knew that the\n",
       "riders had wondered at Oldring's inactivity in that particular field.\n",
       "He and his band had been active enough in their visits to Glaze and\n",
       "Cottonwoods; they always had gold; but of late the amount gambled\n",
       "away and drunk and thrown away in the villages had given rise to much\n",
       "conjecture. Oldring's more frequent visits had resulted in new saloons,\n",
       "and where there had formerly been one raid or shooting fray in the\n",
       "little hamlets there were now many. Perhaps Oldring had another range\n",
       "farther on up the pass, and from there drove the cattle to distant Utah\n",
       "towns where he was little known But Venters came finally to doubt this.\n",
       "And, from what he had learned in the last few days, a belief began to\n",
       "form in Venters's mind that Oldring's intimidations of the villages and\n",
       "the mystery of the Masked Rider, with his alleged evil deeds, and the\n",
       "fierce resistance offered any trailing riders, and the rustling of\n",
       "cattle--these things were only the craft of the rustler-chief to conceal\n",
       "his real life and purpose and work in Deception Pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "And like a scouting Indian Venters crawled through the sage of the oval\n",
       "valley, crossed trail after trail on the north side, and at last entered\n",
       "the canyon out of which headed the cattle trail, and into which he had\n",
       "watched the rustlers disappear.\n",
       "\n",
       "If he had used caution before, now he strained every nerve to force\n",
       "himself to creeping stealth and to sensitiveness of ear. He crawled\n",
       "along so hidden that he could not use his eyes except to aid himself in\n",
       "the toilsome progress through the brakes and ruins of cliff-wall. Yet\n",
       "from time to time, as he rested, he saw the massive red walls growing\n",
       "higher and wilder, more looming and broken. He made note of the fact\n",
       "that he was turning and climbing. The sage and thickets of oak and\n",
       "brakes of alder gave place to pinyon pine growing out of rocky soil.\n",
       "Suddenly a low, dull murmur assailed his ears. At first he thought it\n",
       "was thunder, then the slipping of a weathered slope of rock. But it was\n",
       "incessant, and as he progressed it filled out deeper and from a murmur\n",
       "changed into a soft roar.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Falling water,” he said. “There's volume to that. I wonder if it's the\n",
       "stream I lost.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The roar bothered him, for he could hear nothing else. Likewise,\n",
       "however, no rustlers could hear him. Emboldened by this and sure that\n",
       "nothing but a bird could see him, he arose from his hands and knees to\n",
       "hurry on. An opening in the pinyons warned him that he was nearing the\n",
       "height of slope.\n",
       "\n",
       "He gained it, and dropped low with a burst of astonishment. Before him\n",
       "stretched a short canyon with rounded stone floor bare of grass or sage\n",
       "or tree, and with curved, shelving walls. A broad rippling stream flowed\n",
       "toward him, and at the back of the canyon waterfall burst from a wide\n",
       "rent in the cliff, and, bounding down in two green steps, spread into a\n",
       "long white sheet.\n",
       "\n",
       "If Venters had not been indubitably certain that he had entered the\n",
       "right canyon his astonishment would not have been so great. There had\n",
       "been no breaks in the walls, no side canyons entering this one where the\n",
       "rustlers' tracks and the cattle trail had guided him, and, therefore, he\n",
       "could not be wrong. But here the canyon ended, and presumably the trails\n",
       "also.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That cattle trail headed out of here,” Venters kept saying to himself.\n",
       "“It headed out. Now what I want to know is how on earth did cattle ever\n",
       "get in here?”\n",
       "\n",
       "If he could be sure of anything it was of the careful scrutiny he had\n",
       "given that cattle track, every hoofmark of which headed straight west.\n",
       "He was now looking east at an immense round boxed corner of canyon down\n",
       "which tumbled a thin, white veil of water, scarcely twenty yards wide.\n",
       "Somehow, somewhere, his calculations had gone wrong. For the first time\n",
       "in years he found himself doubting his rider's skill in finding tracks,\n",
       "and his memory of what he had actually seen. In his anxiety to keep\n",
       "under cover he must have lost himself in this offshoot of Deception\n",
       "Pass, and thereby in some unaccountable manner, missed the canyon with\n",
       "the trails. There was nothing else for him to think. Rustlers could not\n",
       "fly, nor cattle jump down thousand-foot precipices. He was only proving\n",
       "what the sage-riders had long said of this labyrinthine system of\n",
       "deceitful canyons and valleys--trails led down into Deception Pass, but\n",
       "no rider had ever followed them.\n",
       "\n",
       "On a sudden he heard above the soft roar of the waterfall an unusual\n",
       "sound that he could not define. He dropped flat behind a stone and\n",
       "listened. From the direction he had come swelled something that\n",
       "resembled a strange muffled pounding and splashing and ringing. Despite\n",
       "his nerve the chill sweat began to dampen his forehead. What might not\n",
       "be possible in this stonewalled maze of mystery? The unnatural sound\n",
       "passed beyond him as he lay gripping his rifle and fighting for\n",
       "coolness. Then from the open came the sound, now distinct and different.\n",
       "Venters recognized a hobble-bell of a horse, and the cracking of iron on\n",
       "submerged stones, and the hollow splash of hoofs in water.\n",
       "\n",
       "Relief surged over him. His mind caught again at realities, and\n",
       "curiosity prompted him to peep from behind the rock.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the middle of the stream waded a long string of packed burros driven\n",
       "by three superbly mounted men. Had Venters met these dark-clothed,\n",
       "dark-visaged, heavily armed men anywhere in Utah, let alone in this\n",
       "robbers' retreat, he would have recognized them as rustlers. The\n",
       "discerning eye of a rider saw the signs of a long, arduous trip. These\n",
       "men were packing in supplies from one of the northern villages. They\n",
       "were tired, and their horses were almost played out, and the burros\n",
       "plodded on, after the manner of their kind when exhausted, faithful and\n",
       "patient, but as if every weary, splashing, slipping step would be their\n",
       "last.\n",
       "\n",
       "All this Venters noted in one glance. After that he watched with a\n",
       "thrilling eagerness. Straight at the waterfall the rustlers drove the\n",
       "burros, and straight through the middle, where the water spread into a\n",
       "fleecy, thin film like dissolving smoke. Following closely, the rustlers\n",
       "rode into this white mist, showing in bold black relief for an instant,\n",
       "and then they vanished.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters drew a full breath that rushed out in brief and sudden\n",
       "utterance.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Good Heaven! Of all the holes for a rustler!... There's a cavern under\n",
       "that waterfall, and a passageway leading out to a canyon beyond. Oldring\n",
       "hides in there. He needs only to guard a trail leading down from\n",
       "the sage-flat above. Little danger of this outlet to the pass being\n",
       "discovered. I stumbled on it by luck, after I had given up. And now I\n",
       "know the truth of what puzzled me most--why that cattle trail was wet!”\n",
       "\n",
       "He wheeled and ran down the slope, and out to the level of the\n",
       "sage-brush. Returning, he had no time to spare, only now and then,\n",
       "between dashes, a moment when he stopped to cast sharp eyes ahead. The\n",
       "abundant grass left no trace of his trail. Short work he made of the\n",
       "distance to the circle of canyons. He doubted that he would ever see it\n",
       "again; he knew he never wanted to; yet he looked at the red corners\n",
       "and towers with the eyes of a rider picturing landmarks never to be\n",
       "forgotten.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here he spent a panting moment in a slow-circling gaze of the sage-oval\n",
       "and the gaps between the bluffs. Nothing stirred except the gentle wave\n",
       "of the tips of the brush. Then he pressed on past the mouths of several\n",
       "canyons and over ground new to him, now close under the eastern wall.\n",
       "This latter part proved to be easy traveling, well screened from\n",
       "possible observation from the north and west, and he soon covered it\n",
       "and felt safer in the deepening shade of his own canyon. Then the huge,\n",
       "notched bulge of red rim loomed over him, a mark by which he knew again\n",
       "the deep cove where his camp lay hidden. As he penetrated the thicket,\n",
       "safe again for the present, his thoughts reverted to the girl he had\n",
       "left there. The afternoon had far advanced. How would he find her? He\n",
       "ran into camp, frightening the dogs.\n",
       "\n",
       "The girl lay with wide-open, dark eyes, and they dilated when he knelt\n",
       "beside her. The flush of fever shone in her cheeks. He lifted her and\n",
       "held water to her dry lips, and felt an inexplicable sense of lightness\n",
       "as he saw her swallow in a slow, choking gulp. Gently he laid her back.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Who--are--you?” she whispered, haltingly.\n",

       "that of late had been neglected. Her father had trained her in the\n",
       "management of a hundred employees and the working of gardens and fields;\n",
       "and to keep record of the movements of cattle and riders. And beside the\n",
       "many duties she had added to this work was one of extreme delicacy, such\n",
       "as required all her tact and ingenuity. It was an unobtrusive, almost\n",
       "secret aid which she rendered to the Gentile families of the village.\n",
       "Though Jane Withersteen never admitted so to herself, it amounted to no\n",
       "less than a system of charity. But for her invention of numberless kinds\n",

       "sighed through the leaves of the cottonwoods, and the running water\n",
       "murmured down its stone-bedded channel. The glimmering of the first star\n",

       "\n",
       "Then, weak and spent, she lay thinking, not of the oppression that would\n",
       "break her, but of this new revelation of self. Until the last few days\n",
       "there had been little in her life to rouse passions. Her forefathers\n",
       "had been Vikings, savage chieftains who bore no cross and brooked no\n",
       "hindrance to their will. Her father had inherited that temper; and at\n",
       "times, like antelope fleeing before fire on the slope, his people fled\n",
       "from his red rages. Jane Withersteen realized that the spirit of wrath\n",
       "and war had lain dormant in her. She shrank from black depths hitherto\n",
       "unsuspected. The one thing in man or woman that she scorned above all\n",
       "scorn, and which she could not forgive, was hate. Hate headed a flaming\n",
       "pathway straight to hell. All in a flash, beyond her control there\n",
       "had been in her a birth of fiery hate. And the man who had dragged her\n",

       "hard to explain. The trail I've been followin' for so many years\n",

       "\n",
       "Jane felt swayed by a strength that far exceeded her own. In a clash of\n",
       "wills with this man she would go to the wall. If she were to influence\n",
       "him it must be wholly through womanly allurement. There was that about\n",
       "Lassiter which commanded her respect. She had abhorred his name; face\n",
       "to face with him, she found she feared only his deeds. His mystic\n",
       "suggestion, his foreshadowing of something that she was to mean to him,\n",
       "pierced deep into her mind. She believed fate had thrown in her way the\n",
       "lover or husband of Milly Erne. She believed that through her an evil\n",
       "man might be reclaimed. His allusion to what he called her blindness\n",
       "terrified her. Such a mistaken idea of his might unleash the bitter,\n",
       "fatal mood she sensed in him. At any cost she must placate this man; she\n",
       "knew the die was cast, and that if Lassiter did not soften to a woman's\n",
       "grace and beauty and wiles, then it would be because she could not make\n",
       "him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon you'll hear no more such talk from me,” Lassiter went on,\n",
       "presently. “Now, Miss Jane, I rode in to tell you that your herd of\n",
       "white steers is down on the slope behind them big ridges. An' I seen\n",
       "somethin' goin' on that'd be mighty interestin' to you, if you could see\n",

       "\n",
       "“Yes, I have two glasses. I'll get them and ride out with you. Wait,\n",
       "Lassiter, please,” she said, and hurried within. Sending word to Jerd to\n",
       "saddle Black Star and fetch him to the court, she then went to her room\n",
       "and changed to the riding-clothes she always donned when going into\n",
       "the sage. In this male attire her mirror showed her a jaunty, handsome\n",
       "rider. If she expected some little need of admiration from Lassiter, she\n",
       "had no cause for disappointment. The gentle smile that she liked, which\n",
       "made of him another person, slowly overspread his face.\n",
       "\n",
       "“If I didn't take you for a boy!” he exclaimed. “It's powerful queer\n",
       "what difference clothes make. Now I've been some scared of your dignity,\n",
       "like when the other night you was all in white but in this rig--”\n",
       "\n",
       "Black Star came pounding into the court, dragging Jerd half off his\n",
       "feet, and he whistled at Lassiter's black. But at sight of Jane all his\n",
       "defiant lines seemed to soften, and with tosses of his beautiful head he\n",
       "whipped his bridle.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Down, Black Star, down,” said Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "He dropped his head, and, slowly lengthening, he bent one foreleg, then\n",
       "the other, and sank to his knees. Jane slipped her left foot in the\n",
       "stirrup, swung lightly into the saddle, and Black Star rose with a\n",
       "ringing stamp. It was not easy for Jane to hold him to a canter through\n",
       "the grove, and like the wind he broke when he saw the sage. Jane let him\n",
       "have a couple of miles of free running on the open trail, and then she\n",
       "coaxed him in and waited for her companion. Lassiter was not long in\n",
       "catching up, and presently they were riding side by side. It reminded\n",
       "her how she used to ride with Venters. Where was he now? She gazed\n",
       "far down the slope to the curved purple lines of Deception Pass and\n",
       "involuntarily shut her eyes with a trembling stir of nameless fear.\n",
       "\n",
       "“We'll turn off here,” Lassiter said, “en' take to the sage a mile or\n",
       "so. The white herd is behind them big ridges.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What are you going to show me?” asked Jane. “I'm prepared--don't be\n",
       "afraid.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He smiled as if he meant that bad news came swiftly enough without being\n",
       "presaged by speech.\n",
       "\n",
       "When they reached the lee of a rolling ridge Lassiter dismounted,\n",
       "motioning to her to do likewise. They left the horses standing, bridles\n",
       "down. Then Lassiter, carrying the field-glasses began to lead the way\n",
       "up the slow rise of ground. Upon nearing the summit he halted her with a\n",
       "gesture.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon we'd see more if we didn't show ourselves against the sky,”\n",
       " he said. “I was here less than an hour ago. Then the herd was seven or\n",
       "eight miles south, an' if they ain't bolted yet--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter!... Bolted?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“That's what I said. Now let's see.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane climbed a few more paces behind him and then peeped over the ridge.\n",
       "Just beyond began a shallow swale that deepened and widened into a\n",
       "valley and then swung to the left. Following the undulating sweep of\n",
       "sage, Jane saw the straggling lines and then the great body of the white\n",
       "herd. She knew enough about steers, even at a distance of four or\n",
       "five miles, to realize that something was in the wind. Bringing her\n",
       "field-glass into use, she moved it slowly from left to right, which\n",
       "action swept the whole herd into range. The stragglers were restless;\n",
       "the more compactly massed steers were browsing. Jane brought the glass\n",
       "back to the big sentinels of the herd, and she saw them trot with quick\n",
       "steps, stop short and toss wide horns, look everywhere, and then trot in\n",
       "another direction.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Judkins hasn't been able to get his boys together yet,” said Jane. “But\n",
       "he'll be there soon. I hope not too late. Lassiter, what's frightening\n",
       "those big leaders?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nothin' jest on the minute,” replied Lassiter. “Them steers are\n",
       "quietin' down. They've been scared, but not bad yet. I reckon the whole\n",
       "herd has moved a few miles this way since I was here.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“They didn't browse that distance--not in less than an hour. Cattle\n",
       "aren't sheep.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, they jest run it, en' that looks bad.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, what frightened them?” repeated Jane, impatiently.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Put down your glass. You'll see at first better with a naked eye. Now\n",
       "look along them ridges on the other side of the herd, the ridges where\n",
       "the sun shines bright on the sage.... That's right. Now look en' look\n",
       "hard en' wait.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Long-drawn moments of straining sight rewarded Jane with nothing save\n",
       "the low, purple rim of ridge and the shimmering sage.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's begun again!” whispered Lassiter, and he gripped her arm.\n",
       "“Watch.... There, did you see that?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, no. Tell me what to look for?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“A white flash--a kind of pin-point of quick light--a gleam as from sun\n",
       "shinin' on somethin' white.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Suddenly Jane's concentrated gaze caught a fleeting glint. Quickly she\n",
       "brought her glass to bear on the spot. Again the purple sage, magnified\n",
       "in color and size and wave, for long moments irritated her with its\n",
       "monotony. Then from out of the sage on the ridge flew up a broad, white\n",
       "object, flashed in the sunlight and vanished. Like magic it was, and\n",
       "bewildered Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What on earth is that?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon there's some one behind that ridge throwin' up a sheet or a\n",
       "white blanket to reflect the sunshine.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why?” queried Jane, more bewildered than ever.\n",
       "\n",
       "“To stampede the herd,” replied Lassiter, and his teeth clicked.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ah!” She made a fierce, passionate movement, clutched the glass\n",
       "tightly, shook as with the passing of a spasm, and then dropped her\n",
       "head. Presently she raised it to greet Lassiter with something like a\n",
       "smile. “My righteous brethren are at work again,” she said, in scorn.\n",
       "She had stifled the leap of her wrath, but for perhaps the first time\n",
       "in her life a bitter derision curled her lips. Lassiter's cool gray eyes\n",
       "seemed to pierce her. “I said I was prepared for anything; but that was\n",
       "hardly true. But why would they--anybody stampede my cattle?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“That's a Mormon's godly way of bringin' a woman to her knees.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, I'll die before I ever bend my knees. I might be led I won't\n",
       "be driven. Do you expect the herd to bolt?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I don't like the looks of them big steers. But you can never tell.\n",
       "Cattle sometimes stampede as easily as buffalo. Any little flash or move\n",
       "will start them. A rider gettin' down an' walkin' toward them sometimes\n",
       "will make them jump an' fly. Then again nothin' seems to scare them.\n",
       "But I reckon that white flare will do the biz. It's a new one on me,\n",
       "an' I've seen some ridin' an' rustlin'. It jest takes one of them\n",
       "God-fearin' Mormons to think of devilish tricks.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, might not this trick be done by Oldring's men?” asked Jane,\n",
       "ever grasping at straws.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It might be, but it ain't,” replied Lassiter. “Oldring's an honest\n",
       "thief. He don't skulk behind ridges to scatter your cattle to the four\n",
       "winds. He rides down on you, an' if you don't like it you can throw a\n",
       "gun.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane bit her tongue to refrain from championing men who at the very\n",
       "moment were proving to her that they were little and mean compared even\n",
       "with rustlers.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Look!... Jane, them leadin' steers have bolted. They're drawin' the\n",
       "stragglers, an' that'll pull the whole herd.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane was not quick enough to catch the details called out by Lassiter,\n",
       "but she saw the line of cattle lengthening. Then, like a stream of white\n",
       "bees pouring from a huge swarm, the steers stretched out from the main\n",
       "body. In a few moments, with astonishing rapidity, the whole herd got\n",
       "into motion. A faint roar of trampling hoofs came to Jane's ears, and\n",
       "gradually swelled; low, rolling clouds of dust began to rise above the\n",
       "sage.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "The long, white, bobbing line of steers streaked swiftly through the\n",

       "\n",
       "“I'm thinkin' of millin' that herd,” said Lassiter. His gray glance\n",
       "swept up the slope to the west. “There's some specks an' dust way off\n",
       "toward the village. Mebbe that's Judkins an' his boys. It ain't likely\n",

       "\n",
       "He ran to his horse and, throwing off saddle-bags and tightening the\n",
       "cinches, he leaped astride and galloped straight down across the valley.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane went for Black Star and, leading him to the summit of the ridge,\n",
       "she mounted and faced the valley with excitement and expectancy. She had\n",
       "heard of milling stampeded cattle, and knew it was a feat accomplished\n",
       "by only the most daring riders.\n",
       "\n",
       "The white herd was now strung out in a line two miles long. The dull\n",
       "rumble of thousands of hoofs deepened into continuous low thunder, and\n",
       "as the steers swept swiftly closer the thunder became a heavy roll.\n",
       "Lassiter crossed in a few moments the level of the valley to the eastern\n",
       "rise of ground and there waited the coming of the herd. Presently, as\n",
       "the head of the white line reached a point opposite to where Jane stood,\n",

       "\n",
       "Jane saw him take a position on the off side of the leaders of the\n",

       "valley, and when the end of the white line neared Lassiter's first\n",
       "stand the head had begun to swing round to the west. It swung slowly and\n",
       "stubbornly, yet surely, and gradually assumed a long, beautiful curve of\n",
       "moving white. To Jane's amaze she saw the leaders swinging, turning till\n",
       "they headed back toward her and up the valley. Out to the right of\n",
       "these wild plunging steers ran Lassiter's black, and Jane's keen eye\n",
       "appreciated the fleet stride and sure-footedness of the blind horse.\n",
       "Then it seemed that the herd moved in a great curve, a huge half-moon\n",
       "with the points of head and tail almost opposite, and a mile apart But\n",
       "Lassiter relentlessly crowded the leaders, sheering them to the left,\n",
       "turning them little by little. And the dust-blinded wild followers\n",
       "plunged on madly in the tracks of their leaders. This ever-moving,\n",
       "ever-changing curve of steers rolled toward Jane and when below her,\n",
       "scarce half a mile, it began to narrow and close into a circle. Lassiter\n",
       "had ridden parallel with her position, turned toward her, then aside,\n",
       "and now he was riding directly away from her, all the time pushing the\n",
       "head of that bobbing line inward.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was then that Jane, suddenly understanding Lassiter's feat stared\n",
       "and gasped at the riding of this intrepid man. His horse was fleet and\n",
       "tireless, but blind. He had pushed the leaders around and around till\n",
       "they were about to turn in on the inner side of the end of that line\n",
       "of steers. The leaders were already running in a circle; the end of the\n",
       "herd was still running almost straight. But soon they would be wheeling.\n",
       "Then, when Lassiter had the circle formed, how would he escape? With\n",
       "Jane Withersteen prayer was as ready as praise; and she prayed for this\n",
       "man's safety. A circle of dust began to collect. Dimly, as through a\n",
       "yellow veil, Jane saw Lassiter press the leaders inward to close the gap\n",
       "in the sage. She lost sight of him in the dust, again she thought she\n",
       "saw the black, riderless now, rear and drag himself and fall. Lassiter\n",
       "had been thrown--lost! Then he reappeared running out of the dust into\n",
       "the sage. He had escaped, and she breathed again.\n",
       "\n",
       "Spellbound, Jane Withersteen watched this stupendous millwheel of\n",

       "closed in upon the open space of sage. And the dust circles closed above\n",
       "into a pall. The ground quaked and the incessant thunder of pounding\n",
       "hoofs rolled on. Jane felt deafened, yet she thrilled to a new sound. As\n",
       "the circle of sage lessened the steers began to bawl, and when it closed\n",
       "entirely there came a great upheaval in the center, and a terrible\n",
       "thumping of heads and clicking of horns. Bawling, climbing, goring, the\n",
       "great mass of steers on the inside wrestled in a crashing din, heaved\n",
       "and groaned under the pressure. Then came a deadlock. The inner strife\n",
       "ceased, and the hideous roar and crash. Movement went on in the outer\n",

       "up the threads of their quarrel where they had parted. Was Tull what\n",
       "he appeared to be? The question flung itself in-voluntarily over Jane\n",

       "along. These “sage-freighters,” as they were called, hauled grain and\n",
       "flour and merchandise from Sterling, and Jane laughed suddenly in the\n",
       "midst of her humility at the thought that they were her property, as was\n",
       "one of the three stores for which they freighted goods. The water that\n",
       "flowed along the path at her feet, and turned into each cottage-yard to\n",

       "platform entrances, and the saloons where tired horses stood with\n",
       "bridles dragging, she was again assured of what was the bread and wine\n",
       "of life to her--that she was loved. Dirty boys playing in the ditch,\n",
       "clerks, teamsters, riders, loungers on the corners, ranchers on dusty\n",

       "and here some thirty Gentile families lived in huts and shacks and\n",
       "log-cabins and several dilapidated cottages. The fortunes of these\n",
       "inhabitants of Cottonwoods could be read in their abodes. Water they had\n",
       "in abundance, and therefore grass and fruit-trees and patches of alfalfa\n",
       "and vegetable gardens. Some of the men and boys had a few stray cattle,\n",
       "others obtained such intermittent employment as the Mormons reluctantly\n",
       "tendered them. But none of the families was prosperous, many were very\n",
       "poor, and some lived only by Jane Withersteen's beneficence.\n",
       "\n",
       "As it made Jane happy to go among her own people, so it saddened her to\n",

       "unwelcome; here she was gratefully received by the women, passionately\n",
       "by the children. But poverty and idleness, with their attendant\n",
       "wretchedness and sorrow, always hurt her. That she could alleviate this\n",
       "distress more now than ever before proved the adage that it was an ill\n",
       "wind that blew nobody good. While her Mormon riders were in her employ\n",
       "she had found few Gentiles who would stay with her, and now she was able\n",

       "body. Red as cherries were her cheeks and lips; her eyes were violet\n",
       "blue, and the crown of her childish loveliness was the curling golden\n",
       "hair. All the children of Cottonwoods were Jane Withersteen's friends,\n",

       "for among the Gentile children there were none near her age, and the\n",

       "\n",
       "Back in that strange canyon, which Venters had found indeed a valley of\n",
       "surprises, the wounded girl's whispered appeal, almost a prayer, not to\n",
       "take her back to the rustlers crowned the events of the last few days\n",
       "with a confounding climax. That she should not want to return to them\n",
       "staggered Venters. Presently, as logical thought returned, her appeal\n",
       "confirmed his first impression--that she was more unfortunate than\n",
       "bad--and he experienced a sensation of gladness. If he had known before\n",
       "that Oldring's Masked Rider was a woman his opinion would have been\n",
       "formed and he would have considered her abandoned. But his first\n",
       "knowledge had come when he lifted a white face quivering in a convulsion\n",
       "of agony; he had heard God's name whispered by blood-stained lips;\n",
       "through her solemn and awful eyes he had caught a glimpse\n",
       "of her soul. And just now had come the entreaty to him,\n",
       "“Don't--take--me--back--there!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Once for all Venters's quick mind formed a permanent conception of this\n",
       "poor girl. He based it, not upon what the chances of life had made her,\n",
       "but upon the revelation of dark eyes that pierced the infinite, upon a\n",
       "few pitiful, halting words that betrayed failure and wrong and misery,\n",
       "yet breathed the truth of a tragic fate rather than a natural leaning to\n",
       "evil.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What's your name?” he inquired.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess,” she answered.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess what?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“That's enough--just Bess.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The red that deepened in her cheeks was not all the flush of fever.\n",
       "Venters marveled anew, and this time at the tint of shame in her face,\n",
       "at the momentary drooping of long lashes. She might be a rustler's girl,\n",
       "but she was still capable of shame, she might be dying, but she still\n",
       "clung to some little remnant of honor.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Very well, Bess. It doesn't matter,” he said. “But this matters--what\n",
       "shall I do with you?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Are--you--a rider?” she whispered.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Not now. I was once. I drove the Withersteen herds. But I lost my\n",
       "place--lost all I owned--and now I'm--I'm a sort of outcast. My name's\n",
       "Bern Venters.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“You won't--take me--to Cottonwoods--or Glaze? I'd be--hanged.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, indeed. But I must do something with you. For it's not safe for\n",
       "me here. I shot that rustler who was with you. Sooner or later he'll\n",
       "be found, and then my tracks. I must find a safer hiding-place where I\n",
       "can't be trailed.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Leave me--here.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Alone--to die!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I will not.” Venters spoke shortly with a kind of ring in his voice.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What--do you want--to do--with me?” Her whispering grew difficult, so\n",
       "low and faint that Venters had to stoop to hear her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why, let's see,” he replied, slowly. “I'd like to take you some place\n",
       "where I could watch by you, nurse you, till you're all right.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“And--then?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, it'll be time to think of that when you're cured of your wound.\n",
       "It's a bad one. And--Bess, if you don't want to live--if you don't fight\n",
       "for life--you'll never--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh! I want--to live! I'm afraid--to die. But I'd rather--die--than go\n",
       "back--to--to--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“To Oldring?” asked Venters, interrupting her in turn.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her lips moved in an affirmative.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I promise not to take you back to him or to Cottonwoods or to Glaze.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The mournful earnestness of her gaze suddenly shone with unutterable\n",
       "gratitude and wonder. And as suddenly Venters found her eyes beautiful\n",
       "as he had never seen or felt beauty. They were as dark blue as the sky\n",
       "at night. Then the flashing changed to a long, thoughtful look, in which\n",
       "there was a wistful, unconscious searching of his face, a look that\n",
       "trembled on the verge of hope and trust.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'll try--to live,” she said. The broken whisper just reached his ears.\n",
       "“Do what--you want--with me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Rest then--don't worry--sleep,” he replied.\n",
       "\n",
       "Abruptly he arose, as if words had been decision for him, and with a\n",
       "sharp command to the dogs he strode from the camp. Venters was conscious\n",
       "of an indefinite conflict of change within him. It seemed to be a\n",
       "vague passing of old moods, a dim coalescing of new forces, a moment of\n",
       "inexplicable transition. He was both cast down and uplifted. He wanted\n",
       "to think and think of the meaning, but he resolutely dispelled emotion.\n",
       "His imperative need at present was to find a safe retreat, and this\n",
       "called for action.\n",
       "\n",
       "So he set out. It still wanted several hours before dark. This trip he\n",
       "turned to the left and wended his skulking way southward a mile or more\n",
       "to the opening of the valley, where lay the strange scrawled rocks. He\n",
       "did not, however, venture boldly out into the open sage, but clung to\n",
       "the right-hand wall and went along that till its perpendicular line\n",
       "broke into the long incline of bare stone.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before proceeding farther he halted, studying the strange character of\n",
       "this slope and realizing that a moving black object could be seen far\n",
       "against such background. Before him ascended a gradual swell of smooth\n",
       "stone. It was hard, polished, and full of pockets worn by centuries\n",
       "of eddying rain-water. A hundred yards up began a line of grotesque\n",
       "cedar-trees, and they extended along the slope clear to its most\n",
       "southerly end. Beyond that end Venters wanted to get, and he concluded\n",
       "the cedars, few as they were, would afford some cover.\n",
       "\n",
       "Therefore he climbed swiftly. The trees were farther up than he\n",
       "had estimated, though he had from long habit made allowance for the\n",
       "deceiving nature of distances in that country. When he gained the cover\n",
       "of cedars he paused to rest and look, and it was then he saw how the\n",
       "trees sprang from holes in the bare rock. Ages of rain had run down the\n",
       "slope, circling, eddying in depressions, wearing deep round holes.\n",
       "There had been dry seasons, accumulations of dust, wind-blown seeds, and\n",
       "cedars rose wonderfully out of solid rock. But these were not beautiful\n",
       "cedars. They were gnarled, twisted into weird contortions, as if growth\n",
       "were torture, dead at the tops, shrunken, gray, and old. Theirs had\n",
       "been a bitter fight, and Venters felt a strange sympathy for them. This\n",
       "country was hard on trees--and men.\n",
       "\n",
       "He slipped from cedar to cedar, keeping them between him and the open\n",
       "valley. As he progressed, the belt of trees widened and he kept to its\n",
       "upper margin. He passed shady pockets half full of water, and, as he\n",
       "marked the location for possible future need, he reflected that there\n",
       "had been no rain since the winter snows. From one of these shady holes a\n",
       "rabbit hopped out and squatted down, laying its ears flat.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters wanted fresh meat now more than when he had only himself to\n",
       "think of. But it would not do to fire his rifle there. So he broke off\n",
       "a cedar branch and threw it. He crippled the rabbit, which started to\n",
       "flounder up the slope. Venters did not wish to lose the meat, and\n",
       "he never allowed crippled game to escape, to die lingeringly in some\n",
       "covert. So after a careful glance below, and back toward the canyon, he\n",
       "began to chase the rabbit.\n",
       "\n",
       "The fact that rabbits generally ran uphill was not new to him. But\n",
       "it presently seemed singular why this rabbit, that might have escaped\n",
       "downward, chose to ascend the slope. Venters knew then that it had a\n",
       "burrow higher up. More than once he jerked over to seize it, only in\n",
       "vain, for the rabbit by renewed effort eluded his grasp. Thus the chase\n",
       "continued on up the bare slope. The farther Venters climbed the more\n",
       "determined he grew to catch his quarry. At last, panting and sweating,\n",
       "he captured the rabbit at the foot of a steeper grade. Laying his rifle\n",
       "on the bulge of rising stone, he killed the animal and slung it from his\n",
       "belt.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before starting down he waited to catch his breath. He had climbed\n",
       "far up that wonderful smooth slope, and had almost reached the base\n",
       "of yellow cliff that rose skyward, a huge scarred and cracked bulk. It\n",
       "frowned down upon him as if to forbid further ascent. Venters bent over\n",
       "for his rifle, and, as he picked it up from where it leaned against the\n",
       "steeper grade, he saw several little nicks cut in the solid stone.\n",
       "\n",
       "They were only a few inches deep and about a foot apart. Venters began\n",
       "to count them--one--two--three--four--on up to sixteen. That number\n",
       "carried his glance to the top of his first bulging bench of cliff-base.\n",
       "Above, after a more level offset, was still steeper slope, and the line\n",
       "of nicks kept on, to wind round a projecting corner of wall.\n",
       "\n",
       "A casual glance would have passed by these little dents; if Venters had\n",
       "not known what they signified he would never have bestowed upon them the\n",
       "second glance. But he knew they had been cut there by hand, and,\n",
       "though age-worn, he recognized them as steps cut in the rock by the\n",
       "cliff-dwellers. With a pulse beginning to beat and hammer away his\n",
       "calmness, he eyed that indistinct line of steps, up to where the\n",
       "buttress of wall hid further sight of them. He knew that behind\n",
       "the corner of stone would be a cave or a crack which could never be\n",
       "suspected from below. Chance, that had sported with him of late, now\n",
       "directed him to a probable hiding-place. Again he laid aside his rifle,\n",
       "and, removing boots and belt, he began to walk up the steps. Like a\n",
       "mountain goat, he was agile, sure-footed, and he mounted the first bench\n",
       "without bending to use his hands. The next ascent took grip of fingers\n",
       "as well as toes, but he climbed steadily, swiftly, to reach the\n",
       "projecting corner, and slipped around it. Here he faced a notch in the\n",
       "cliff. At the apex he turned abruptly into a ragged vent that split the\n",
       "ponderous wall clear to the top, showing a narrow streak of blue sky.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the base this vent was dark, cool, and smelled of dry, musty dust.\n",
       "It zigzagged so that he could not see ahead more than a few yards at a\n",
       "time. He noticed tracks of wildcats and rabbits in the dusty floor. At\n",
       "every turn he expected to come upon a huge cavern full of little square\n",
       "stone houses, each with a small aperture like a staring dark eye. The\n",
       "passage lightened and widened, and opened at the foot of a narrow,\n",
       "steep, ascending chute.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters had a moment's notice of the rock, which was of the same\n",
       "smoothness and hardness as the slope below, before his gaze went\n",
       "irresistibly upward to the precipitous walls of this wide ladder of\n",
       "granite. These were ruined walls of yellow sandstone, and so split and\n",
       "splintered, so overhanging with great sections of balancing rim, so\n",
       "impending with tremendous crumbling crags, that Venters caught his\n",
       "breath sharply, and, appalled, he instinctively recoiled as if a step\n",
       "upward might jar the ponderous cliffs from their foundation. Indeed, it\n",
       "seemed that these ruined cliffs were but awaiting a breath of wind\n",
       "to collapse and come tumbling down. Venters hesitated. It would be a\n",
       "foolhardy man who risked his life under the leaning, waiting avalanches\n",
       "of rock in that gigantic split. Yet how many years had they leaned there\n",
       "without falling! At the bottom of the incline was an immense heap of\n",
       "weathered sandstone all crumbling to dust, but there were no huge rocks\n",
       "as large as houses, such as rested so lightly and frightfully above,\n",
       "waiting patiently and inevitably to crash down. Slowly split from the\n",
       "parent rock by the weathering process, and carved and sculptured by ages\n",
       "of wind and rain, they waited their moment. Venters felt how foolish\n",
       "it was for him to fear these broken walls; to fear that, after they had\n",
       "endured for thousands of years, the moment of his passing should be the\n",
       "one for them to slip. Yet he feared it.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What a place to hide!” muttered Venters. “I'll climb--I'll see where\n",
       "this thing goes. If only I can find water!”\n",
       "\n",
       "With teeth tight shut he essayed the incline. And as he climbed he bent\n",
       "his eyes downward. This, however, after a little grew impossible; he had\n",
       "to look to obey his eager, curious mind. He raised his glance and saw\n",
       "light between row on row of shafts and pinnacles and crags that stood\n",
       "out from the main wall. Some leaned against the cliff, others against\n",
       "each other; many stood sheer and alone; all were crumbling, cracked,\n",
       "rotten. It was a place of yellow, ragged ruin. The passage narrowed as\n",
       "he went up; it became a slant, hard for him to stick on; it was smooth\n",
       "as marble. Finally he surmounted it, surprised to find the walls still\n",
       "several hundred feet high, and a narrow gorge leading down on the other\n",
       "side. This was a divide between two inclines, about twenty yards wide.\n",
       "At one side stood an enormous rock. Venters gave it a second glance,\n",
       "because it rested on a pedestal. It attracted closer attention. It was\n",
       "like a colossal pear of stone standing on its stem. Around the bottom\n",
       "were thousands of little nicks just distinguishable to the eye. They\n",
       "were marks of stone hatchets. The cliff-dwellers had chipped and chipped\n",
       "away at this boulder till it rested its tremendous bulk upon a mere\n",
       "pin-point of its surface. Venters pondered. Why had the little stone-men\n",
       "hacked away at that big boulder? It bore no semblance to a statue or an\n",
       "idol or a godhead or a sphinx. Instinctively he put his hands on it\n",
       "and pushed; then his shoulder and heaved. The stone seemed to groan, to\n",
       "stir, to grate, and then to move. It tipped a little downward and hung\n",
       "balancing for a long instant, slowly returned, rocked slightly, groaned,\n",
       "and settled back to its former position.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters divined its significance. It had been meant for defense. The\n",
       "cliff-dwellers, driven by dreaded enemies to this last stand, had\n",
       "cunningly cut the rock until it balanced perfectly, ready to be\n",
       "dislodged by strong hands. Just below it leaned a tottering crag that\n",
       "would have toppled, starting an avalanche on an acclivity where no\n",
       "sliding mass could stop. Crags and pinnacles, splintered cliffs, and\n",
       "leaning shafts and monuments, would have thundered down to block forever\n",
       "the outlet to Deception Pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That was a narrow shave for me,” said Venters, soberly. “A balancing\n",
       "rock! The cliff-dwellers never had to roll it. They died, vanished,\n",
       "and here the rock stands, probably little changed.... But it might serve\n",
       "another lonely dweller of the cliffs. I'll hide up here somewhere, if I\n",
       "can only find water.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He descended the gorge on the other side. The slope was gradual, the\n",
       "space narrow, the course straight for many rods. A gloom hung between\n",
       "the up-sweeping walls. In a turn the passage narrowed to scarce a dozen\n",
       "feet, and here was darkness of night. But light shone ahead; another\n",
       "abrupt turn brought day again, and then wide open space.\n",
       "\n",
       "Above Venters loomed a wonderful arch of stone bridging the canyon rims,\n",
       "and through the enormous round portal gleamed and glistened a beautiful\n",
       "valley shining under sunset gold reflected by surrounding cliffs. He\n",
       "gave a start of surprise. The valley was a cove a mile long, half\n",
       "that wide, and its enclosing walls were smooth and stained, and curved\n",
       "inward, forming great caves. He decided that its floor was far higher\n",
       "than the level of Deception Pass and the intersecting canyons. No purple\n",
       "sage colored this valley floor. Instead there were the white of aspens,\n",
       "streaks of branch and slender trunk glistening from the green of leaves,\n",
       "and the darker green of oaks, and through the middle of this forest,\n",
       "from wall to wall, ran a winding line of brilliant green which marked\n",
       "the course of cottonwoods and willows.\n",
       "\n",
       "“There's water here--and this is the place for me,” said Venters. “Only\n",
       "birds can peep over those walls, I've gone Oldring one better.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters waited no longer, and turned swiftly to retrace his steps. He\n",
       "named the canyon Surprise Valley and the huge boulder that guarded the\n",
       "outlet Balancing Rock. Going down he did not find himself attended by\n",
       "such fears as had beset him in the climb; still, he was not easy in\n",
       "mind and could not occupy himself with plans of moving the girl and his\n",
       "outfit until he had descended to the notch. There he rested a moment and\n",
       "looked about him. The pass was darkening with the approach of night. At\n",
       "the corner of the wall, where the stone steps turned, he saw a spur of\n",
       "rock that would serve to hold the noose of a lasso. He needed no more\n",
       "aid to scale that place. As he intended to make the move under cover\n",
       "of darkness, he wanted most to be able to tell where to climb up. So,\n",
       "taking several small stones with him, he stepped and slid down to the\n",
       "edge of the slope where he had left his rifle and boots. He placed the\n",
       "stones some yards apart. He left the rabbit lying upon the bench where\n",
       "the steps began. Then he addressed a keen-sighted, remembering gaze to\n",
       "the rim-wall above. It was serrated, and between two spears of rock,\n",
       "directly in line with his position, showed a zigzag crack that at night\n",
       "would let through the gleam of sky. This settled, he put on his belt\n",
       "and boots and prepared to descend. Some consideration was necessary to\n",
       "decide whether or not to leave his rifle there. On the return, carrying\n",
       "the girl and a pack, it would be added encumbrance; and after debating\n",
       "the matter he left the rifle leaning against the bench. As he went\n",
       "straight down the slope he halted every few rods to look up at his mark\n",
       "on the rim. It changed, but he fixed each change in his memory. When he\n",
       "reached the first cedar-tree, he tied his scarf upon a dead branch, and\n",
       "then hurried toward camp, having no more concern about finding his trail\n",
       "upon the return trip.\n",
       "\n",
       "Darkness soon emboldened and lent him greater speed. It occurred to him,\n",
       "as he glided into the grassy glade near camp and head the whinny of a\n",
       "horse, that he had forgotten Wrangle. The big sorrel could not be gotten\n",
       "into Surprise Valley. He would have to be left here.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters determined at once to lead the other horses out through the\n",
       "thicket and turn them loose. The farther they wandered from this canyon\n",
       "the better it would suit him. He easily descried Wrangle through the\n",
       "gloom, but the others were not in sight. Venters whistled low for the\n",
       "dogs, and when they came trotting to him he sent them out to search for\n",
       "the horses, and followed. It soon developed that they were not in the\n",
       "glade nor the thicket. Venters grew cold and rigid at the thought of\n",
       "rustlers having entered his retreat. But the thought passed, for the\n",
       "demeanor of Ring and Whitie reassured him. The horses had wandered away.\n",
       "\n",
       "Under the clump of silver spruces a denser mantle of darkness, yet not\n",
       "so thick that Venter's night-practiced eyes could not catch the white\n",
       "oval of a still face. He bent over it with a slight suspension of breath\n",
       "that was both caution lest he frighten her and chill uncertainty of\n",
       "feeling lest he find her dead. But she slept, and he arose to renewed\n",
       "activity.\n",
       "\n",
       "He packed his saddle-bags. The dogs were hungry, they whined about\n",
       "him and nosed his busy hands; but he took no time to feed them nor to\n",
       "satisfy his own hunger. He slung the saddlebags over his shoulders and\n",
       "made them secure with his lasso. Then he wrapped the blankets closer\n",
       "about the girl and lifted her in his arms. Wrangle whinnied and thumped\n",
       "the ground as Venters passed him with the dogs. The sorrel knew he was\n",
       "being left behind, and was not sure whether he liked it or not. Venters\n",
       "went on and entered the thicket. Here he had to feel his way in pitch\n",
       "blackness and to wedge his progress between the close saplings. Time\n",
       "meant little to him now that he had started, and he edged along with\n",
       "slow side movement till he got clear of the thicket. Ring and Whitie\n",
       "stood waiting for him. Taking to the open aisles and patches of the\n",
       "sage, he walked guardedly, careful not to stumble or step in dust or\n",
       "strike against spreading sage-branches.\n",
       "\n",
       "If he were burdened he did not feel it. From time to time, when he\n",
       "passed out of the black lines of shade into the wan starlight, he\n",
       "glanced at the white face of the girl lying in his arms. She had not\n",
       "awakened from her sleep or stupor. He did not rest until he cleared the\n",
       "black gate of the canyon. Then he leaned against a stone breast-high to\n",
       "him and gently released the girl from his hold. His brow and hair\n",
       "and the palms of his hands were wet, and there was a kind of nervous\n",
       "contraction of his muscles. They seemed to ripple and string tense. He\n",
       "had a desire to hurry and no sense of fatigue. A wind blew the scent\n",
       "of sage in his face. The first early blackness of night passed with the\n",
       "brightening of the stars. Somewhere back on his trail a coyote yelped,\n",
       "splitting the dead silence. Venters's faculties seemed singularly acute.\n",
       "\n",
       "He lifted the girl again and pressed on. The valley better traveling\n",
       "than the canyon. It was lighter, freer of sage, and there were no rocks.\n",
       "Soon, out of the pale gloom shone a still paler thing, and that was the\n",
       "low swell of slope. Venters mounted it and his dogs walked beside him.\n",
       "Once upon the stone he slowed to snail pace, straining his sight to\n",
       "avoid the pockets and holes. Foot by foot he went up. The weird cedars,\n",
       "like great demons and witches chained to the rock and writhing in silent\n",
       "anguish, loomed up with wide and twisting naked arms. Venters crossed\n",
       "this belt of cedars, skirted the upper border, and recognized the tree\n",
       "he had marked, even before he saw his waving scarf.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here he knelt and deposited the girl gently, feet first and slowly laid\n",
       "her out full length. What he feared was to reopen one of her wounds.\n",
       "If he gave her a violent jar, or slipped and fell! But the supreme\n",
       "confidence so strangely felt that night admitted no such blunders.\n",
       "\n",
       "The slope before him seemed to swell into obscurity to lose its definite\n",
       "outline in a misty, opaque cloud that shaded into the over-shadowing\n",
       "wall. He scanned the rim where the serrated points speared the sky, and\n",
       "he found the zigzag crack. It was dim, only a shade lighter than the\n",
       "dark ramparts, but he distinguished it, and that served.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lifting the girl, he stepped upward, closely attending to the nature of\n",
       "the path under his feet. After a few steps he stopped to mark his line\n",
       "with the crack in the rim. The dogs clung closer to him. While chasing\n",
       "the rabbit this slope had appeared interminable to him; now, burdened as\n",
       "he was, he did not think of length or height or toil. He remembered\n",
       "only to avoid a misstep and to keep his direction. He climbed on, with\n",
       "frequent stops to watch the rim, and before he dreamed of gaining the\n",
       "bench he bumped his knees into it, and saw, in the dim gray light, his\n",
       "rifle and the rabbit. He had come straight up without mishap or swerving\n",
       "off his course, and his shut teeth unlocked.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he laid the girl down in the shallow hollow of the little ridge with\n",
       "her white face upturned, she opened her eyes. Wide, staring black, at\n",
       "once like both the night and the stars, they made her face seem still\n",
       "whiter.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Is--it--you?” she asked, faintly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes,” replied Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh! Where--are we?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm taking you to a safe place where no one will ever find you. I must\n",
       "climb a little here and call the dogs. Don't be afraid. I'll soon come\n",
       "for you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "She said no more. Her eyes watched him steadily for a moment and then\n",
       "closed. Venters pulled off his boots and then felt for the little steps\n",
       "in the rock. The shade of the cliff above obscured the point he wanted\n",
       "to gain, but he could see dimly a few feet before him. What he had\n",
       "attempted with care he now went at with surpassing lightness. Buoyant,\n",
       "rapid, sure, he attained the corner of wall and slipped around it. Here\n",
       "he could not see a hand before his face, so he groped along, found a\n",
       "little flat space, and there removed the saddle-bags. The lasso he took\n",
       "back with him to the corner and looped the noose over the spur of rock.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ring--Whitie--come,” he called, softly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Low whines came up from below.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Here! Come, Whitie--Ring,” he repeated, this time sharply.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then followed scraping of claws and pattering of feet; and out of the\n",
       "gray gloom below him swiftly climbed the dogs to reach his side and pass\n",
       "beyond.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters descended, holding to the lasso. He tested its strength by\n",
       "throwing all his weight upon it. Then he gathered the girl up, and,\n",
       "holding her securely in his left arm, he began to climb, at every few\n",
       "steps jerking his right hand upward along the lasso. It sagged at each\n",
       "forward movement he made, but he balanced himself lightly during the\n",
       "interval when he lacked the support of a taut rope. He climbed as if he\n",
       "had wings, the strength of a giant, and knew not the sense of fear. The\n",
       "sharp corner of cliff seemed to cut out of the darkness. He reached\n",
       "it and the protruding shelf, and then, entering the black shade of the\n",
       "notch, he moved blindly but surely to the place where he had left the\n",
       "saddle-bags. He heard the dogs, though he could not see them. Once more\n",
       "he carefully placed the girl at his feet. Then, on hands and knees,\n",
       "he went over the little flat space, feeling for stones. He removed a\n",
       "number, and, scraping the deep dust into a heap, he unfolded the outer\n",
       "blanket from around the girl and laid her upon this bed. Then he went\n",
       "down the slope again for his boots, rifle, and the rabbit, and, bringing\n",
       "also his lasso with him, he made short work of that trip.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Are--you--there?” The girl's voice came low from the blackness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes,” he replied, and was conscious that his laboring breast made\n",
       "speech difficult.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Are we--in a cave?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, listen!... The waterfall!... I hear it! You've brought me back!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters heard a murmuring moan that one moment swelled to a pitch almost\n",
       "softly shrill and the next lulled to a low, almost inaudible sigh.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That's--wind blowing--in the--cliffs,” he panted. “You're far from\n",
       "Oldring's--canyon.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The effort it cost him to speak made him conscious of extreme lassitude\n",
       "following upon great exertion. It seemed that when he lay down and drew\n",
       "his blanket over him the action was the last before utter prostration.\n",
       "He stretched inert, wet, hot, his body one great strife of throbbing,\n",
       "stinging nerves and bursting veins. And there he lay for a long while\n",
       "before he felt that he had begun to rest.\n",
       "\n",
       "Rest came to him that night, but no sleep. Sleep he did not want. The\n",
       "hours of strained effort were now as if they had never been, and he\n",
       "wanted to think. Earlier in the day he had dismissed an inexplicable\n",
       "feeling of change; but now, when there was no longer demand on his\n",
       "cunning and strength and he had time to think, he could not catch the\n",
       "illusive thing that had sadly perplexed as well as elevated his spirit.\n",
       "\n",
       "Above him, through a V-shaped cleft in the dark rim of the cliff, shone\n",
       "the lustrous stars that had been his lonely accusers for a long, long\n",
       "year. To-night they were different. He studied them. Larger, whiter,\n",
       "more radiant they seemed; but that was not the difference he meant.\n",
       "Gradually it came to him that the distinction was not one he saw, but\n",
       "one he felt. In this he divined as much of the baffling change as he\n",
       "thought would be revealed to him then. And as he lay there, with the\n",
       "singing of the cliff-winds in his ears, the white stars above the dark,\n",

       "then the lighting of dawn.\n",
       "\n",
       "When he had bestirred himself, feeding the hungry dogs and breaking\n",
       "his long fast, and had repacked his saddle-bags, it was clear daylight,\n",
       "though the sun had not tipped the yellow wall in the east. He concluded\n",
       "to make the climb and descent into Surprise Valley in one trip. To that\n",
       "end he tied his blanket upon Ring and gave Whitie the extra lasso and\n",
       "the rabbit to carry. Then, with the rifle and saddle-bags slung upon his\n",
       "back, he took up the girl. She did not awaken from heavy slumber.\n",
       "\n",
       "That climb up under the rugged, menacing brows of the broken cliffs,\n",
       "in the face of a grim, leaning boulder that seemed to be weary of its\n",
       "age-long wavering, was a tax on strength and nerve that Venters\n",
       "felt equally with something sweet and strangely exulting in its\n",
       "accomplishment. He did not pause until he gained the narrow divide and\n",
       "there he rested. Balancing Rock loomed huge, cold in the gray light\n",
       "of dawn, a thing without life, yet it spoke silently to Venters: “I am\n",
       "waiting to plunge down, to shatter and crash, roar and boom, to bury\n",
       "your trail, and close forever the outlet to Deception Pass!”\n",
       "\n",
       "On the descent of the other side Venters had easy going, but was\n",
       "somewhat concerned because Whitie appeared to have succumbed to\n",

       "Ring evidently regarded this as an injury to himself, especially as he\n",

       "\n",
       "Venters turned out of the gorge, and suddenly paused stock-still,\n",
       "astounded at the scene before him. The curve of the great stone bridge\n",
       "had caught the sunrise, and through the magnificent arch burst a\n",
       "glorious stream of gold that shone with a long slant down into the\n",
       "center of Surprise Valley. Only through the arch did any sunlight\n",

       "that spread fan-shape from the arch, and encountered a grassy terrace\n",
       "running to the right and about on a level with the tips of the oaks and\n",
       "cottonwoods below. Scattered here and there upon this shelf were clumps\n",
       "of aspens, and he walked through them into a glade that surpassed in\n",
       "beauty and adaptability for a wild home, any place he had ever seen.\n",
       "Silver spruces bordered the base of a precipitous wall that rose\n",
       "loftily. Caves indented its surface, and there were no detached ledges\n",
       "or weathered sections that might dislodge a stone. The level ground,\n",
       "beyond the spruces, dropped down into a little ravine. This was one\n",
       "dense line of slender aspens from which came the low splashing of water.\n",
       "And the terrace, lying open to the west, afforded unobstructed view of\n",
       "the valley of green treetops.\n",
       "\n",
       "For his camp Venters chose a shady, grassy plot between the silver\n",
       "spruces and the cliff. Here, in the stone wall, had been wonderfully\n",
       "carved by wind or washed by water several deep caves above the level of\n",
       "the terrace. They were clean, dry, roomy.\n",
       "\n",
       "He cut spruce boughs and made a bed in the largest cave and laid the\n",
       "girl there. The first intimation that he had of her being aroused from\n",
       "sleep or lethargy was a low call for water.\n",
       "\n",
       "He hurried down into the ravine with his canteen. It was a shallow,\n",
       "grass-green place with aspens growing up everywhere. To his delight\n",
       "he found a tiny brook of swift-running water. Its faint tinge of amber\n",
       "reminded him of the spring at Cottonwoods, and the thought gave him a\n",
       "little shock. The water was so cold it made his fingers tingle as he\n",
       "dipped the canteen. Having returned to the cave, he was glad to see the\n",
       "girl drink thirstily. This time he noted that she could raise her head\n",
       "slightly without his help.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You were thirsty,” he said. “It's good water. I've found a fine place.\n",
       "Tell me--how do you feel?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“There's pain--here,” she replied, and moved her hand to her left side.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why, that's strange! Your wounds are on your right side. I believe\n",
       "you're hungry. Is the pain a kind of dull ache--a gnawing?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's like--that.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Then it's hunger.” Venters laughed, and suddenly caught himself with a\n",
       "quick breath and felt again the little shock. When had he laughed? “It's\n",
       "hunger,” he went on. “I've had that gnaw many a time. I've got it now.\n",
       "But you mustn't eat. You can have all the water you want, but no food\n",
       "just yet.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Won't I--starve?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, people don't starve easily. I've discovered that. You must lie\n",
       "perfectly still and rest and sleep--for days.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“My hands--are dirty; my face feels--so hot and sticky; my boots hurt.”\n",
       " It was her longest speech as yet, and it trailed off in a whisper.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, I'm a fine nurse!”\n",
       "\n",
       "It annoyed him that he had never thought of these things. But then,\n",
       "awaiting her death and thinking of her comfort were vastly different\n",
       "matters. He unwrapped the blanket which covered her. What a slender girl\n",
       "she was! No wonder he had been able to carry her miles and pack her up\n",
       "that slippery ladder of stone. Her boots were of soft, fine leather,\n",
       "reaching clear to her knees. He recognized the make as one of a\n",
       "boot-maker in Sterling. Her spurs, that he had stupidly neglected to\n",
       "remove, consisted of silver frames and gold chains, and the rowels,\n",
       "large as silver dollars, were fancifully engraved. The boots slipped off\n",
       "rather hard. She wore heavy woollen rider's stockings, half length, and\n",
       "these were pulled up over the ends of her short trousers. Venters took\n",
       "off the stockings to note her little feet were red and swollen. He\n",
       "bathed them. Then he removed his scarf and bathed her face and hands.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I must see your wounds now,” he said, gently.\n",
       "\n",
       "She made no reply, but watched him steadily as he opened her blouse and\n",
       "untied the bandage. His strong fingers trembled a little as he removed\n",
       "it. If the wounds had reopened! A chill struck him as he saw the angry\n",
       "red bullet-mark, and a tiny stream of blood winding from it down her\n",
       "white breast. Very carefully he lifted her to see that the wound in her\n",
       "back had closed perfectly. Then he washed the blood from her breast,\n",
       "bathed the wound, and left it unbandaged, open to the air.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her eyes thanked him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Listen,” he said, earnestly. “I've had some wounds, and I've seen many.\n",
       "I know a little about them. The hole in your back has closed. If you lie\n",
       "still three days the one in your breast will close and you'll be safe.\n",
       "The danger from hemorrhage will be over.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He had spoken with earnest sincerity, almost eagerness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why--do you--want me--to get well?” she asked, wonderingly.\n",
       "\n",
       "The simple question seemed unanswerable except on grounds of humanity.\n",
       "But the circumstances under which he had shot this strange girl, the\n",
       "shock and realization, the waiting for death, the hope, had resulted in\n",
       "a condition of mind wherein Venters wanted her to live more than he had\n",
       "ever wanted anything. Yet he could not tell why. He believed the killing\n",
       "of the rustler and the subsequent excitement had disturbed him. For how\n",
       "else could he explain the throbbing of his brain, the heat of his blood,\n",
       "the undefined sense of full hours, charged, vibrant with pulsating\n",
       "mystery where once they had dragged in loneliness?\n",
       "\n",
       "“I shot you,” he said, slowly, “and I want you to get well so I shall\n",
       "not have killed a woman. But--for your own sake, too--”\n",
       "\n",
       "A terrible bitterness darkened her eyes, and her lips quivered.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hush,” said Venters. “You've talked too much already.”\n",
       "\n",
       "In her unutterable bitterness he saw a darkness of mood that could not\n",
       "have been caused by her present weak and feverish state. She hated the\n",
       "life she had led, that she probably had been compelled to lead. She\n",
       "had suffered some unforgivable wrong at the hands of Oldring. With that\n",
       "conviction Venters felt a shame throughout his body, and it marked the\n",
       "rekindling of fierce anger and ruthlessness. In the past long year he\n",
       "had nursed resentment. He had hated the wilderness--the loneliness of\n",
       "the uplands. He had waited for something to come to pass. It had come.\n",
       "Like an Indian stealing horses he had skulked into the recesses of the\n",
       "canyons. He had found Oldring's retreat; he had killed a rustler; he had\n",
       "shot an unfortunate girl, then had saved her from this unwitting act,\n",
       "and he meant to save her from the consequent wasting of blood, from\n",
       "fever and weakness. Starvation he had to fight for her and for himself.\n",
       "Where he had been sick at the letting of blood, now he remembered it in\n",
       "grim, cold calm. And as he lost that softness of nature, so he lost his\n",
       "fear of men. He would watch for Oldring, biding his time, and he would\n",
       "kill this great black-bearded rustler who had held a girl in bondage,\n",
       "who had used her to his infamous ends.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters surmised this much of the change in him--idleness had passed;\n",
       "keen, fierce vigor flooded his mind and body; all that had happened to\n",
       "him at Cottonwoods seemed remote and hard to recall; the difficulties\n",
       "and perils of the present absorbed him, held him in a kind of spell.\n",
       "\n",
       "First, then, he fitted up the little cave adjoining the girl's room\n",
       "for his own comfort and use. His next work was to build a fireplace of\n",
       "stones and to gather a store of wood. That done, he spilled the contents\n",
       "of his saddle-bags upon the grass and took stock. His outfit consisted\n",
       "of a small-handled axe, a hunting-knife, a large number of cartridges\n",
       "for rifle or revolver, a tin plate, a cup, and a fork and spoon,\n",
       "a quantity of dried beef and dried fruits, and small canvas bags\n",
       "containing tea, sugar, salt, and pepper. For him alone this supply would\n",
       "have been bountiful to begin a sojourn in the wilderness, but he was no\n",
       "longer alone. Starvation in the uplands was not an unheard-of thing;\n",
       "he did not, however, worry at all on that score, and feared only his\n",
       "possible inability to supply the needs of a woman in a weakened and\n",
       "extremely delicate condition.\n",
       "\n",
       "If there was no game in the valley--a contingency he doubted--it would\n",
       "not be a great task for him to go by night to Oldring's herd and pack\n",
       "out a calf. The exigency of the moment was to ascertain if there were\n",
       "game in Surprise Valley. Whitie still guarded the dilapidated rabbit,\n",
       "and Ring slept near by under a spruce. Venters called Ring and went to\n",
       "the edge of the terrace, and there halted to survey the valley.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was prepared to find it larger than his unstudied glances had made it\n",
       "appear; for more than a casual idea of dimensions and a hasty conception\n",
       "of oval shape and singular beauty he had not had time. Again the\n",
       "felicity of the name he had given the valley struck him forcibly. Around\n",
       "the red perpendicular walls, except under the great arc of stone, ran\n",
       "a terrace fringed at the cliff-base by silver spruces; below that first\n",
       "terrace sloped another wider one densely overgrown with aspens, and the\n",
       "center of the valley was a level circle of oaks and alders, with the\n",
       "glittering green line of willows and cottonwood dividing it in half.\n",
       "Venters saw a number and variety of birds flitting among the trees.\n",
       "To his left, facing the stone bridge, an enormous cavern opened in the\n",
       "wall; and low down, just above the tree-tops, he made out a long shelf\n",
       "of cliff-dwellings, with little black, staring windows or doors. Like\n",
       "eyes they were, and seemed to watch him. The few cliff-dwellings he had\n",
       "seen--all ruins--had left him with haunting memory of age and solitude\n",
       "and of something past. He had come, in a way, to be a cliff-dweller\n",
       "himself, and those silent eyes would look down upon him, as if in\n",
       "surprise that after thousands of years a man had invaded the valley.\n",
       "Venters felt sure that he was the only white man who had ever walked\n",
       "under the shadow of the wonderful stone bridge, down into that wonderful\n",
       "valley with its circle of caves and its terraced rings of silver spruce\n",
       "and aspens.\n",
       "\n",
       "The dog growled below and rushed into the forest. Venters ran down the\n",
       "declivity to enter a zone of light shade streaked with sunshine. The\n",
       "oak-trees were slender, none more than half a foot thick, and they grew\n",
       "close together, intermingling their branches. Ring came running back\n",
       "with a rabbit in his mouth. Venters took the rabbit and, holding the\n",
       "dog near him, stole softly on. There were fluttering of wings among the\n",
       "branches and quick bird-notes, and rustling of dead leaves and rapid\n",
       "patterings. Venters crossed well-worn trails marked with fresh tracks;\n",
       "and when he had stolen on a little farther he saw many birds and running\n",
       "quail, and more rabbits than he could count. He had not penetrated the\n",
       "forest of oaks for a hundred yards, had not approached anywhere near the\n",
       "line of willows and cottonwoods which he knew grew along a stream. But\n",
       "he had seen enough to know that Surprise Valley was the home of many\n",
       "wild creatures.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters returned to camp. He skinned the rabbits, and gave the dogs the\n",
       "one they had quarreled over, and the skin of this he dressed and hung\n",
       "up to dry, feeling that he would like to keep it. It was a particularly\n",
       "rich, furry pelt with a beautiful white tail. Venters remembered that\n",
       "but for the bobbing of that white tail catching his eye he would not\n",
       "have espied the rabbit, and he would never have discovered Surprise\n",
       "Valley. Little incidents of chance like this had turned him here\n",
       "and there in Deception Pass; and now they had assumed to him the\n",
       "significance and direction of destiny.\n",
       "\n",
       "His good fortune in the matter of game at hand brought to his mind the\n",
       "necessity of keeping it in the valley. Therefore he took the axe and cut\n",
       "bundles of aspens and willows, and packed them up under the bridge to\n",
       "the narrow outlet of the gorge. Here he began fashioning a fence, by\n",
       "driving aspens into the ground and lacing them fast with willows. Trip\n",
       "after trip he made down for more building material, and the afternoon\n",
       "had passed when he finished the work to his satisfaction. Wildcats might\n",
       "scale the fence, but no coyote could come in to search for prey, and no\n",
       "rabbits or other small game could escape from the valley.\n",
       "\n",
       "Upon returning to camp he set about getting his supper at ease, around a\n",
       "fine fire, without hurry or fear of discovery. After hard work that\n",
       "had definite purpose, this freedom and comfort gave him peculiar\n",
       "satisfaction. He caught himself often, as he kept busy round the\n",
       "camp-fire, stopping to glance at the quiet form in the cave, and at\n",
       "the dogs stretched cozily near him, and then out across the beautiful\n",
       "valley. The present was not yet real to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "While he ate, the sun set beyond a dip in the rim of the curved wall. As\n",
       "the morning sun burst wondrously through a grand arch into this valley,\n",
       "in a golden, slanting shaft, so the evening sun, at the moment of\n",
       "setting, shone through a gap of cliffs, sending down a broad red burst\n",
       "to brighten the oval with a blaze of fire. To Venters both sunrise and\n",
       "sunset were unreal.\n",
       "\n",
       "A cool wind blew across the oval, waving the tips of oaks, and while\n",
       "the light lasted, fluttering the aspen leaves into millions of facets of\n",
       "red, and sweeping the graceful spruces. Then with the wind soon came\n",
       "a shade and a darkening, and suddenly the valley was gray. Night came\n",
       "there quickly after the sinking of the sun. Venters went softly to look\n",
       "at the girl. She slept, and her breathing was quiet and slow. He lifted\n",
       "Ring into the cave, with stern whisper for him to stay there on\n",
       "guard. Then he drew the blanket carefully over her and returned to the\n",
       "camp-fire.\n",
       "\n",
       "Though exceedingly tired, he was yet loath to yield to lassitude, but\n",
       "this night it was not from listening, watchful vigilance; it was from\n",
       "a desire to realize his position. The details of his wild environment\n",
       "seemed the only substance of a strange dream. He saw the darkening rims,\n",
       "the gray oval turning black, the undulating surface of forest, like a\n",
       "rippling lake, and the spear-pointed spruces. He heard the flutter\n",
       "of aspen leaves and the soft, continuous splash of falling water. The\n",
       "melancholy note of a canyon bird broke clear and lonely from the high\n",
       "cliffs. Venters had no name for this night singer, and he had never seen\n",
       "one, but the few notes, always pealing out just at darkness, were as\n",
       "familiar to him as the canyon silence. Then they ceased, and the rustle\n",
       "of leaves and the murmur of water hushed in a growing sound that Venters\n",
       "fancied was not of earth. Neither had he a name for this, only it was\n",
       "inexpressibly wild and sweet. The thought came that it might be a moan\n",
       "of the girl in her last outcry of life, and he felt a tremor shake him.\n",
       "But no! This sound was not human, though it was like despair. He began\n",
       "to doubt his sensitive perceptions, to believe that he half-dreamed what\n",
       "he thought he heard. Then the sound swelled with the strengthening\n",
       "of the breeze, and he realized it was the singing of the wind in the\n",
       "cliffs.\n",
       "\n",
       "By and by a drowsiness overcame him, and Venters began to nod, half\n",
       "asleep, with his back against a spruce. Rousing himself and calling\n",
       "Whitie, he went to the cave. The girl lay barely visible in the dimness.\n",
       "Ring crouched beside her, and the patting of his tail on the stone\n",
       "assured Venters that the dog was awake and faithful to his duty. Venters\n",
       "sought his own bed of fragrant boughs; and as he lay back, somehow\n",
       "grateful for the comfort and safety, the night seemed to steal away from\n",
       "him and he sank softly into intangible space and rest and slumber.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters awakened to the sound of melody that he imagined was only the\n",
       "haunting echo of dream music. He opened his eyes to another surprise\n",
       "of this valley of beautiful surprises. Out of his cave he saw the\n",
       "exquisitely fine foliage of the silver spruces crossing a round space\n",
       "of blue morning sky; and in this lacy leafage fluttered a number of\n",
       "gray birds with black and white stripes and long tails. They were\n",
       "mocking-birds, and they were singing as if they wanted to burst their\n",
       "throats. Venters listened. One long, silver-tipped branch dropped almost\n",
       "to his cave, and upon it, within a few yards of him, sat one of the\n",
       "graceful birds. Venters saw the swelling and quivering of its throat\n",
       "in song. He arose, and when he slid down out of his cave the birds\n",
       "fluttered and flew farther away.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters stepped before the opening of the other cave and looked in. The\n",
       "girl was awake, with wide eyes and listening look, and she had a hand on\n",
       "Ring's neck.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Mocking-birds!” she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes,” replied Venters, “and I believe they like our company.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Where are we?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Never mind now. After a little I'll tell you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“The birds woke me. When I heard them--and saw the shiny trees--and the\n",
       "blue sky--and then a blaze of gold dropping down--I wondered--”\n",
       "\n",
       "She did not complete her fancy, but Venters imagined he understood her\n",
       "meaning. She appeared to be wandering in mind. Venters felt her face and\n",
       "hands and found them burning with fever. He went for water, and was glad\n",
       "to find it almost as cold as if flowing from ice. That water was the\n",
       "only medicine he had, and he put faith in it. She did not want to drink,\n",
       "but he made her swallow, and then he bathed her face and head and cooled\n",
       "her wrists.\n",
       "\n",
       "The day began with the heightening of the fever. Venters spent the time\n",
       "reducing her temperature, cooling her hot cheeks and temples. He kept\n",
       "close watch over her, and at the least indication of restlessness, that\n",
       "he knew led to tossing and rolling of the body, he held her tightly, so\n",
       "no violent move could reopen her wounds. Hour after hour she babbled and\n",
       "laughed and cried and moaned in delirium; but whatever her secret was\n",
       "she did not reveal it. Attended by something somber for Venters, the day\n",
       "passed. At night in the cool winds the fever abated and she slept.\n",
       "\n",
       "The second day was a repetition of the first. On the third he seemed to\n",
       "see her wither and waste away before his eyes. That day he scarcely went\n",
       "from her side for a moment, except to run for fresh, cool water; and he\n",
       "did not eat. The fever broke on the fourth day and left her spent and\n",
       "shrunken, a slip of a girl with life only in her eyes. They hung upon\n",
       "Venters with a mute observance, and he found hope in that.\n",
       "\n",
       "To rekindle the spark that had nearly flickered out, to nourish the\n",
       "little life and vitality that remained in her, was Venters's problem.\n",
       "But he had little resource other than the meat of the rabbits and quail;\n",
       "and from these he made broths and soups as best he could, and fed her\n",
       "with a spoon. It came to him that the human body, like the human soul,\n",
       "was a strange thing and capable of recovering from terrible shocks. For\n",
       "almost immediately she showed faint signs of gathering strength. There\n",
       "was one more waiting day, in which he doubted, and spent long hours by\n",
       "her side as she slept, and watched the gentle swell of her breast rise\n",
       "and fall in breathing, and the wind stir the tangled chestnut curls. On\n",
       "the next day he knew that she would live.\n",
       "\n",
       "Upon realizing it he abruptly left the cave and sought his accustomed\n",
       "seat against the trunk of a big spruce, where once more he let his\n",
       "glance stray along the sloping terraces. She would live, and the somber\n",
       "gloom lifted out of the valley, and he felt relief that was pain. Then\n",
       "he roused to the call of action, to the many things he needed to do\n",
       "in the way of making camp fixtures and utensils, to the necessity of\n",
       "hunting food, and the desire to explore the valley.\n",
       "\n",
       "But he decided to wait a few more days before going far from camp,\n",
       "because he fancied that the girl rested easier when she could see him\n",
       "near at hand. And on the first day her languor appeared to leave her in\n",
       "a renewed grip of life. She awoke stronger from each short slumber; she\n",
       "ate greedily, and she moved about in her bed of boughs; and always, it\n",
       "seemed to Venters, her eyes followed him. He knew now that her recovery\n",
       "would be rapid. She talked about the dogs, about the caves, the valley,\n",
       "about how hungry she was, till Venters silenced her, asking her to put\n",
       "off further talk till another time. She obeyed, but she sat up in her\n",
       "bed, and her eyes roved to and fro, and always back to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Upon the second morning she sat up when he awakened her, and would not\n",
       "permit him to bathe her face and feed her, which actions she performed\n",
       "for herself. She spoke little, however, and Venters was quick to\n",
       "catch in her the first intimations of thoughtfulness and curiosity and\n",
       "appreciation of her situation. He left camp and took Whitie out to\n",
       "hunt for rabbits. Upon his return he was amazed and somewhat anxiously\n",
       "concerned to see his invalid sitting with her back to a corner of the\n",
       "cave and her bare feet swinging out. Hurriedly he approached, intending\n",
       "to advise her to lie down again, to tell her that perhaps she might\n",
       "overtax her strength. The sun shone upon her, glinting on the little\n",
       "head with its tangle of bright hair and the small, oval face with its\n",
       "pallor, and dark-blue eyes underlined by dark-blue circles. She looked\n",
       "at him and he looked at her. In that exchange of glances he imagined\n",
       "each saw the other in some different guise. It seemed impossible to\n",
       "Venters that this frail girl could be Oldring's Masked Rider. It flashed\n",
       "over him that he had made a mistake which presently she would explain.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Help me down,” she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "“But--are you well enough?” he protested. “Wait--a little longer.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm weak--dizzy. But I want to get down.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He lifted her--what a light burden now!--and stood her upright beside\n",
       "him, and supported her as she essayed to walk with halting steps. She\n",
       "was like a stripling of a boy; the bright, small head scarcely reached\n",
       "his shoulder. But now, as she clung to his arm, the rider's costume she\n",
       "wore did not contradict, as it had done at first, his feeling of her\n",
       "femininity. She might be the famous Masked Rider of the uplands, she\n",
       "might resemble a boy; but her outline, her little hands and feet, her\n",
       "hair, her big eyes and tremulous lips, and especially a something that\n",
       "Venters felt as a subtle essence rather than what he saw, proclaimed her\n",
       "sex.\n",
       "\n",
       "She soon tired. He arranged a comfortable seat for her under the spruce\n",
       "that overspread the camp-fire.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Now tell me--everything,” she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "He recounted all that had happened from the time of his discovery of the\n",
       "rustlers in the canyon up to the present moment.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You shot me--and now you've saved my life?”\n",

       "\n",
       "“Tell me--about yourself?” she asked.\n",
       "\n",
       "He made this a briefer story, telling of his coming to Utah, his\n",
       "various occupations till he became a rider, and then how the Mormons had\n",
       "practically driven him out of Cottonwoods, an outcast.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, no longer able to withstand his own burning curiosity, he\n",

       "\n",
       "“Are you Oldring's Masked Rider?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes,” she replied, and dropped her eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I knew it--I recognized your figure--and mask, for I saw you once.\n",
       "Yet I can't believe it!... But you never were really that rustler, as we\n",
       "riders knew him? A thief--a marauder--a kidnapper of women--a murderer\n",
       "of sleeping riders!”\n",
       "\n",

       "you ride. But the black mask--the mystery--the things laid to your\n",
       "hands--the threats in your infamous name--the night-riding credited\n",
       "to you--the evil deeds deliberately blamed on you and acknowledged by\n",
       "rustlers--even Oldring himself! Why? Tell me why?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I never knew that,” she answered low. Her drooping head straightened,\n",
       "and the large eyes, larger now and darker, met Venters's with a clear,\n",
       "steadfast gaze in which he read truth. It verified his own conviction.\n",

       "ask for a truth that would be abhorrent for him to confirm, but which he\n",
       "seemed driven to hear.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What are--what were you to Oldring?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Like some delicate thing suddenly exposed to blasting heat, the girl\n",

       "so different--his thought when spoken. Yet her shame established in his\n",

       "I was a lonely outcast. And now!... I don't see very clearly what it all\n",

       "surely till you are well. But you'll never go back to Oldring. And I'm\n",
       "sure helping you will help me, for I was sick in mind. There's something\n",
       "now for me to do. And if I can win back your strength--then get you\n",

       "CHAPTER X. LOVE\n",
       "\n",
       "During all these waiting days Venters, with the exception of the\n",
       "afternoon when he had built the gate in the gorge, had scarcely gone\n",
       "out of sight of camp and never out of hearing. His desire to explore\n",
       "Surprise Valley was keen, and on the morning after his long talk with\n",
       "the girl he took his rifle and, calling Ring, made a move to start. The\n",
       "girl lay back in a rude chair of boughs he had put together for her. She\n",
       "had been watching him, and when he picked up the gun and called the dog\n",
       "Venters thought she gave a nervous start.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm only going to look over the valley,” he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Will you be gone long?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No,” he replied, and started off. The incident set him thinking of his\n",
       "former impression that, after her recovery from fever, she did not seem\n",
       "at ease unless he was close at hand. It was fear of being alone, due, he\n",
       "concluded, most likely to her weakened condition. He must not leave her\n",
       "much alone.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he strode down the sloping terrace, rabbits scampered before him,\n",
       "and the beautiful valley quail, as purple in color as the sage on the\n",
       "uplands, ran fleetly along the ground into the forest. It was pleasant\n",
       "under the trees, in the gold-flecked shade, with the whistle of quail\n",
       "and twittering of birds everywhere. Soon he had passed the limit of his\n",
       "former excursions and entered new territory. Here the woods began to\n",
       "show open glades and brooks running down from the slope, and presently\n",
       "he emerged from shade into the sunshine of a meadow. The shaking of the\n",
       "high grass told him of the running of animals, what species he could\n",
       "not tell, but from Ring's manifest desire to have a chase they were\n",
       "evidently some kind wilder than rabbits. Venters approached the willow\n",
       "and cottonwood belt that he had observed from the height of slope.\n",
       "He penetrated it to find a considerable stream of water and great\n",
       "half-submerged mounds of brush and sticks, and all about him were old\n",
       "and new gnawed circles at the base of the cottonwoods.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Beaver!” he exclaimed. “By all that's lucky! The meadow's full of\n",
       "beaver! How did they ever get here?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Beaver had not found a way into the valley by the trail of the\n",
       "cliff-dwellers, of that he was certain; and he began to have more than\n",
       "curiosity as to the outlet or inlet of the stream. When he passed some\n",
       "dead water, which he noted was held by a beaver dam, there was a current\n",
       "in the stream, and it flowed west. Following its course, he soon entered\n",
       "the oak forest again, and passed through to find himself before massed\n",
       "and jumbled ruins of cliff wall. There were tangled thickets of\n",
       "wild plum-trees and other thorny growths that made passage extremely\n",
       "laborsome. He found innumerable tracks of wildcats and foxes. Rustlings\n",
       "in the thick undergrowth told him of stealthy movements of these\n",
       "animals. At length his further advance appeared futile, for the reason\n",
       "that the stream disappeared in a split at the base of immense rocks over\n",
       "which he could not climb. To his relief he concluded that though beaver\n",
       "might work their way up the narrow chasm where the water rushed, it\n",
       "would be impossible for men to enter the valley there.\n",
       "\n",
       "This western curve was the only part of the valley where the walls had\n",
       "been split asunder, and it was a wildly rough and inaccessible corner.\n",
       "Going back a little way, he leaped the stream and headed toward the\n",
       "southern wall. Once out of the oaks he found again the low terrace of\n",
       "aspens, and above that the wide, open terrace fringed by silver spruces.\n",
       "This side of the valley contained the wind or water worn caves. As he\n",
       "pressed on, keeping to the upper terrace, cave after cave opened out of\n",
       "the cliff; now a large one, now a small one. Then yawned, quite suddenly\n",
       "and wonderfully above him, the great cavern of the cliff-dwellers.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was still a goodly distance, and he tried to imagine, if it appeared\n",
       "so huge from where he stood, what it would be when he got there. He\n",
       "climbed the terrace and then faced a long, gradual ascent of weathered\n",
       "rock and dust, which made climbing too difficult for attention to\n",
       "anything else. At length he entered a zone of shade, and looked up.\n",
       "He stood just within the hollow of a cavern so immense that he had no\n",
       "conception of its real dimensions. The curved roof, stained by ages\n",
       "of leakage, with buff and black and rust-colored streaks, swept up and\n",
       "loomed higher and seemed to soar to the rim of the cliff. Here again was\n",
       "a magnificent arch, such as formed the grand gateway to the valley, only\n",
       "in this instance it formed the dome of a cave instead of the span of a\n",
       "bridge.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters passed onward and upward. The stones he dislodged rolled down\n",
       "with strange, hollow crack and roar. He had climbed a hundred rods\n",
       "inward, and yet he had not reached the base of the shelf where the\n",
       "cliff-dwellings rested, a long half-circle of connected stone house,\n",
       "with little dark holes that he had fancied were eyes. At length he\n",
       "gained the base of the shelf, and here found steps cut in the rock.\n",
       "These facilitated climbing, and as he went up he thought how easily this\n",
       "vanished race of men might once have held that stronghold against an\n",
       "army. There was only one possible place to ascend, and this was narrow\n",
       "and steep.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters had visited cliff-dwellings before, and they had been in ruins,\n",
       "and of no great character or size but this place was of proportions that\n",
       "stunned him, and it had not been desecrated by the hand of man, nor had\n",
       "it been crumbled by the hand of time. It was a stupendous tomb. It had\n",
       "been a city. It was just as it had been left by its builders. The little\n",
       "houses were there, the smoke-blackened stains of fires, the pieces of\n",
       "pottery scattered about cold hearths, the stone hatchets; and stone\n",
       "pestles and mealing-stones lay beside round holes polished by years\n",
       "of grinding maize--lay there as if they had been carelessly dropped\n",
       "yesterday. But the cliff-dwellers were gone!\n",
       "\n",
       "Dust! They were dust on the floor or at the foot of the shelf, and their\n",
       "habitations and utensils endured. Venters felt the sublimity of that\n",
       "marvelous vaulted arch, and it seemed to gleam with a glory of something\n",
       "that was gone. How many years had passed since the cliff-dwellers gazed\n",
       "out across the beautiful valley as he was gazing now? How long had it\n",
       "been since women ground grain in those polished holes? What time had\n",
       "rolled by since men of an unknown race lived, loved, fought, and died\n",
       "there? Had an enemy destroyed them? Had disease destroyed them, or only\n",
       "that greatest destroyer--time? Venters saw a long line of blood-red\n",
       "hands painted low down upon the yellow roof of stone. Here was strange\n",
       "portent, if not an answer to his queries. The place oppressed him. It\n",
       "was light, but full of a transparent gloom. It smelled of dust and musty\n",
       "stone, of age and disuse. It was sad. It was solemn. It had the look\n",
       "of a place where silence had become master and was now irrevocable and\n",
       "terrible and could not be broken. Yet, at the moment, from high up in\n",
       "the carved crevices of the arch, floated down the low, strange wail of\n",
       "wind--a knell indeed for all that had gone.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters, sighing, gathered up an armful of pottery, such pieces as he\n",
       "thought strong enough and suitable for his own use, and bent his steps\n",
       "toward camp. He mounted the terrace at an opposite point to which he\n",
       "had left. He saw the girl looking in the direction he had gone. His\n",
       "footsteps made no sound in the deep grass, and he approached close\n",
       "without her being aware of his presence. Whitie lay on the ground near\n",
       "where she sat, and he manifested the usual actions of welcome, but the\n",
       "girl did not notice them. She seemed to be oblivious to everything near\n",
       "at hand. She made a pathetic figure drooping there, with her sunny hair\n",
       "contrasting so markedly with her white, wasted cheeks and her hands\n",
       "listlessly clasped and her little bare feet propped in the framework of\n",
       "the rude seat. Venters could have sworn and laughed in one breath at the\n",
       "idea of the connection between this girl and Oldring's Masked Rider. She\n",
       "was the victim of more than accident of fate--a victim to some deep\n",
       "plot the mystery of which burned him. As he stepped forward with a\n",
       "half-formed thought that she was absorbed in watching for his return,\n",
       "she turned her head and saw him. A swift start, a change rather than\n",
       "rush of blood under her white cheeks, a flashing of big eyes that fixed\n",
       "their glance upon him, transformed her face in that single instant of\n",
       "turning, and he knew she had been watching for him, that his return was\n",
       "the one thing in her mind. She did not smile; she did not flush; she\n",
       "did not look glad. All these would have meant little compared to her\n",
       "indefinite expression. Venters grasped the peculiar, vivid, vital\n",
       "something that leaped from her face. It was as if she had been in a\n",
       "dead, hopeless clamp of inaction and feeling, and had been suddenly shot\n",
       "through and through with quivering animation. Almost it was as if she\n",
       "had returned to life.\n",
       "\n",
       "And Venters thought with lightning swiftness, “I've saved her--I've\n",
       "unlinked her from that old life--she was watching as if I were all she\n",
       "had left on earth--she belongs to me!” The thought was startlingly new.\n",
       "Like a blow it was in an unprepared moment. The cheery salutation he had\n",
       "ready for her died unborn and he tumbled the pieces of pottery awkwardly\n",
       "on the grass while some unfamiliar, deep-seated emotion, mixed with pity\n",
       "and glad assurance of his power to succor her, held him dumb.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What a load you had!” she said. “Why, they're pots and crocks! Where\n",
       "did you get them?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters laid down his rifle, and, filling one of the pots from his\n",
       "canteen, he placed it on the smoldering campfire.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hope it'll hold water,” he said, presently. “Why, there's an enormous\n",
       "cliff-dwelling just across here. I got the pottery there. Don't you\n",
       "think we needed something? That tin cup of mine has served to make tea,\n",
       "broth, soup--everything.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I noticed we hadn't a great deal to cook in.”\n",
       "\n",
       "She laughed. It was the first time. He liked that laugh, and though he\n",
       "was tempted to look at her, he did not want to show his surprise or his\n",
       "pleasure.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Will you take me over there, and all around in the valley--pretty soon,\n",
       "when I'm well?” she added.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Indeed I shall. It's a wonderful place. Rabbits so thick you can't step\n",
       "without kicking one out. And quail, beaver, foxes, wildcats. We're in a\n",
       "regular den. But--haven't you ever seen a cliff-dwelling?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No. I've heard about them, though. The--the men say the Pass is full of\n",
       "old houses and ruins.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why, I should think you'd have run across one in all your riding\n",
       "around,” said Venters. He spoke slowly, choosing his words carefully,\n",
       "and he essayed a perfectly casual manner, and pretended to be busy\n",
       "assorting pieces of pottery. She must have no cause again to suffer\n",
       "shame for curiosity of his. Yet never in all his days had he been so\n",
       "eager to hear the details of anyone's life.\n",
       "\n",
       "“When I rode--I rode like the wind,” she replied, “and never had time to\n",
       "stop for anything.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I remember that day I--I met you in the Pass--how dusty you were, how\n",
       "tired your horse looked. Were you always riding?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, no. Sometimes not for months, when I was shut up in the cabin.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters tried to subdue a hot tingling.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You were shut up, then?” he asked, carelessly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“When Oldring went away on his long trips--he was gone for months\n",
       "sometimes--he shut me up in the cabin.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What for?”\n",

       "thought of her past. Occasionally he tried to piece together the several\n",

       "not want to leave Surprise Valley at all. But it was imperative that he\n",
       "consider practical matters; and whether or not he was destined to stay\n",
       "long there, he felt the immediate need of a change of diet. It would be\n",
       "necessary for him to go farther afield for a variety of meat, and also\n",
       "that he soon visit Cottonwoods for a supply of food.\n",
       "\n",
       "It occurred again to Venters that he could go to the canyon where\n",

       "gloom. Balancing Rock loomed dark and leaned over the pale descent.\n",
       "Transformed in the shadowy light, it took shape and dimensions of a\n",
       "spectral god waiting--waiting for the moment to hurl himself down upon\n",
       "the tottering walls and close forever the outlet to Deception Pass. At\n",
       "night more than by day Venters felt something fearful and fateful in\n",
       "that rock, and that it had leaned and waited through a thousand years to\n",
       "have somehow to deal with his destiny.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Old man, if you must roll, wait till I get back to the girl, and then\n",
       "roll!” he said, aloud, as if the stones were indeed a god.\n",
       "\n",
       "And those spoken words, in their grim note to his ear, as well as\n",
       "contents to his mind, told Venters that he was all but drifting on a\n",
       "current which he had not power nor wish to stem.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters exercised his usual care in the matter of hiding tracks from the\n",
       "outlet, yet it took him scarcely an hour to reach Oldring's cattle.\n",
       "Here sight of many calves changed his original intention, and instead\n",
       "of packing out meat he decided to take a calf out alive. He roped one,\n",
       "securely tied its feet, and swung it over his shoulder. Here was an\n",
       "exceedingly heavy burden, but Venters was powerful--he could take up\n",
       "a sack of grain and with ease pitch it over a pack-saddle--and he made\n",
       "long distance without resting. The hardest work came in the climb up to\n",
       "the outlet and on through to the valley. When he had accomplished it,\n",
       "he became fired with another idea that again changed his intention.\n",
       "He would not kill the calf, but keep it alive. He would go back to\n",
       "Oldring's herd and pack out more calves. Thereupon he secured the calf\n",
       "in the best available spot for the moment and turned to make a second\n",
       "trip.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Venters got back to the valley with another calf, it was close upon\n",
       "daybreak. He crawled into his cave and slept late. Bess had no inkling\n",
       "that he had been absent from camp nearly all night, and only remarked\n",
       "solicitously that he appeared to be more tired than usual, and more in\n",
       "the need of sleep. In the afternoon Venters built a gate across a small\n",

       "\n",
       "That night he made two more trips to Oldring's range, and again on the\n",

       "that he did not want to kill one. “I've rustled Oldring's cattle,” he\n",
       "said, and laughed. He noted then that all the calves were red. “Red!”\n",

       "\n",
       "One more trip he undertook to Oldring's valley, and this time he roped\n",
       "a yearling steer and killed it and cut out a small quarter of beef. The\n",
       "howling of coyotes told him he need have no apprehension that the work\n",
       "of his knife would be discovered. He packed the beef back to camp and\n",

       "the cottonwoods was the coming of the child to the gloomy house of\n",
       "Withersteen. The big, silent halls echoed with childish laughter. In the\n",
       "shady court, where Jane spent many of the hot July days, Fay's tiny\n",
       "feet pattered over the stone flags and splashed in the amber stream. She\n",
       "prattled incessantly. What difference, Jane thought, a child made in her\n",
       "home! It had never been a real home, she discovered. Even the tidiness\n",
       "and neatness she had so observed, and upon which she had insisted to her\n",
       "women, became, in the light of Fay's smile, habits that now lost their\n",
       "importance. Fay littered the court with Jane's books and papers, and\n",
       "other toys her fancy improvised, and many a strange craft went floating\n",
       "down the little brook.\n",
       "\n",
       "And it was owing to Fay's presence that Jane Withersteen came to see\n",
       "more of Lassiter. The rider had for the most part kept to the sage. He\n",
       "rode for her, but he did not seek her except on business; and Jane had\n",
       "to acknowledge in pique that her overtures had been made in vain. Fay,\n",
       "however, captured Lassiter the moment he first laid eyes on her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane was present at the meeting, and there was something about it which\n",
       "dimmed her sight and softened her toward this foe of her people. The\n",
       "rider had clanked into the court, a tired yet wary man, always looking\n",
       "for the attack upon him that was inevitable and might come from any\n",
       "quarter; and he had walked right upon little Fay. The child had been\n",
       "beautiful even in her rags and amid the surroundings of the hovel in the\n",
       "sage, but now, in a pretty white dress, with her shining curls brushed\n",
       "and her face clean and rosy, she was lovely. She left her play and\n",
       "looked up at Lassiter.\n",
       "\n",
       "If there was not an instinct for all three of them in that meeting, an\n",
       "unreasoning tendency toward a closer intimacy, then Jane Withersteen\n",
       "believed she had been subject to a queer fancy. She imagined any child\n",
       "would have feared Lassiter. And Fay Larkin had been a lonely, a solitary\n",
       "elf of the sage, not at all an ordinary child, and exquisitely shy\n",
       "with strangers. She watched Lassiter with great, round, grave eyes, but\n",
       "showed no fear. The rider gave Jane a favorable report of cattle and\n",
       "horses; and as he took the seat to which she invited him, little Fay\n",
       "edged as much as half an inch nearer. Jane replied to his look of\n",
       "inquiry and told Fay's story. The rider's gray, earnest gaze troubled\n",
       "her. Then he turned to Fay and smiled in a way that made Jane doubt her\n",
       "sense of the true relation of things. How could Lassiter smile so at a\n",
       "child when he had made so many children fatherless? But he did smile,\n",
       "and to the gentleness she had seen a few times he added something that\n",
       "was infinitely sad and sweet. Jane's intuition told her that Lassiter\n",
       "had never been a father, but if life ever so blessed him he would be a\n",
       "good one. Fay, also, must have found that smile singularly winning. For\n",
       "she edged closer and closer, and then, by way of feminine capitulation,\n",
       "went to Jane, from whose side she bent a beautiful glance upon the\n",
       "rider.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter only smiled at her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane watched them, and realized that now was the moment she should\n",
       "seize, if she was ever to win this man from his hatred. But the step was\n",
       "not easy to take. The more she saw of Lassiter the more she respected\n",
       "him, and the greater her respect the harder it became to lend herself to\n",
       "mere coquetry. Yet as she thought of her great motive, of Tull, and\n",
       "of that other whose name she had schooled herself never to think of\n",
       "in connection with Milly Erne's avenger, she suddenly found she had no\n",
       "choice. And her creed gave her boldness far beyond the limit to which\n",
       "vanity would have led her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, I see so little of you now,” she said, and was conscious of\n",
       "heat in her cheeks.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I've been riding hard,” he replied.\n",
       "\n",
       "“But you can't live in the saddle. You come in sometimes. Won't you come\n",
       "here to see me--oftener?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Is that an order?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nonsense! I simply ask you to come to see me when you find time.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The query once heard was not so embarrassing to Jane as she might have\n",
       "imagined. Moreover, it established in her mind a fact that there existed\n",
       "actually other than selfish reasons for her wanting to see him. And as\n",
       "she had been bold, so she determined to be both honest and brave.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I've reasons--only one of which I need mention,” she answered. “If it's\n",
       "possible I want to change you toward my people. And on the moment I can\n",
       "conceive of little I wouldn't do to gain that end.”\n",
       "\n",
       "How much better and freer Jane felt after that confession! She meant to\n",
       "show him that there was one Mormon who could play a game or wage a fight\n",
       "in the open.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon,” said Lassiter, and he laughed.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was the best in her, if the most irritating, that Lassiter always\n",
       "aroused.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Will you come?” She looked into his eyes, and for the life of her could\n",
       "not quite subdue an imperiousness that rose with her spirit. “I never\n",
       "asked so much of any man--except Bern Venters.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“'Pears to me that you'd run no risk, or Venters, either. But mebbe that\n",
       "doesn't hold good for me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“You mean it wouldn't be safe for you to be often here? You look for\n",
       "ambush in the cottonwoods?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Not that so much.”\n",
       "\n",
       "At this juncture little Fay sidled over to Lassiter.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Has oo a little dirl?” she inquired.\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, lassie,” replied the rider.\n",
       "\n",
       "Whatever Fay seemed to be searching for in Lassiter's sun-reddened face\n",
       "and quiet eyes she evidently found. “Oo tan tom to see me,” she added,\n",
       "and with that, shyness gave place to friendly curiosity. First his\n",
       "sombrero with its leather band and silver ornaments commanded her\n",
       "attention; next his quirt, and then the clinking, silver spurs. These\n",
       "held her for some time, but presently, true to childish fickleness, she\n",
       "left off playing with them to look for something else. She laughed in\n",
       "glee as she ran her little hands down the slippery, shiny surface\n",
       "of Lassiter's leather chaps. Soon she discovered one of the hanging\n",
       "gun--sheaths, and she dragged it up and began tugging at the huge black\n",
       "handle of the gun. Jane Withersteen repressed an exclamation. What\n",
       "significance there was to her in the little girl's efforts to dislodge\n",
       "that heavy weapon! Jane Withersteen saw Fay's play and her beauty and\n",
       "her love as most powerful allies to her own woman's part in a game that\n",
       "suddenly had acquired a strange zest and a hint of danger. And as for\n",
       "the rider, he appeared to have forgotten Jane in the wonder of this\n",
       "lovely child playing about him. At first he was much the shyer of the\n",
       "two. Gradually her confidence overcame his backwardness, and he had the\n",
       "temerity to stroke her golden curls with a great hand. Fay rewarded his\n",
       "boldness with a smile, and when he had gone to the extreme of closing\n",
       "that great hand over her little brown one, she said, simply, “I like\n",
       "oo!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Sight of his face then made Jane oblivious for the time to his character\n",
       "as a hater of Mormons. Out of the mother longing that swelled her breast\n",
       "she divined the child hunger in Lassiter.\n",
       "\n",
       "He returned the next day, and the next; and upon the following he came\n",
       "both at morning and at night. Upon the evening of this fourth day Jane\n",
       "seemed to feel the breaking of a brooding struggle in Lassiter. During\n",
       "all these visits he had scarcely a word to say, though he watched her\n",
       "and played absent-mindedly with Fay. Jane had contented herself with\n",
       "silence. Soon little Fay substituted for the expression of regard, “I\n",
       "like oo,” a warmer and more generous one, “I love oo.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Thereafter Lassiter came oftener to see Jane and her little protegee.\n",
       "Daily he grew more gentle and kind, and gradually developed a quaintly\n",
       "merry mood. In the morning he lifted Fay upon his horse and let her\n",
       "ride as he walked beside her to the edge of the sage. In the evening he\n",
       "played with the child at an infinite variety of games she invented,\n",
       "and then, oftener than not, he accepted Jane's invitation to supper. No\n",
       "other visitor came to Withersteen House during those days. So that in\n",
       "spite of watchfulness he never forgot, Lassiter began to show he felt at\n",
       "home there. After the meal they walked into the grove of cottonwoods or\n",
       "up by the lakes, and little Fay held Lassiter's hand as much as she held\n",
       "Jane's. Thus a strange relationship was established, and Jane liked it.\n",
       "At twilight they always returned to the house, where Fay kissed them and\n",
       "went in to her mother. Lassiter and Jane were left alone.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, if there were anything that a good woman could do to win a man\n",
       "and still preserve her self-respect, it was something which escaped the\n",
       "natural subtlety of a woman determined to allure. Jane's vanity, that\n",
       "after all was not great, was soon satisfied with Lassiter's silent\n",
       "admiration. And her honest desire to lead him from his dark,\n",
       "blood-stained path would never have blinded her to what she owed\n",
       "herself. But the driving passion of her religion, and its call to save\n",
       "Mormons' lives, one life in particular, bore Jane Withersteen close to\n",
       "an infringement of her womanhood. In the beginning she had reasoned that\n",
       "her appeal to Lassiter must be through the senses. With whatever means\n",
       "she possessed in the way of adornment she enhanced her beauty. And she\n",
       "stooped to artifices that she knew were unworthy of her, but which\n",
       "she deliberately chose to employ. She made of herself a girl in every\n",
       "variable mood wherein a girl might be desirable. In those moods she was\n",
       "not above the methods of an inexperienced though natural flirt. She\n",
       "kept close to him whenever opportunity afforded; and she was forever\n",
       "playfully, yet passionately underneath the surface, fighting him for\n",
       "possession of the great black guns. These he would never yield to her.\n",
       "And so in that manner their hands were often and long in contact. The\n",
       "more of simplicity that she sensed in him the greater the advantage she\n",
       "took.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had a trick of changing--and it was not altogether voluntary--from\n",
       "this gay, thoughtless, girlish coquettishness to the silence and the\n",
       "brooding, burning mystery of a woman's mood. The strength and passion\n",
       "and fire of her were in her eyes, and she so used them that Lassiter had\n",
       "to see this depth in her, this haunting promise more fitted to her years\n",
       "than to the flaunting guise of a wilful girl.\n",
       "\n",
       "The July days flew by. Jane reasoned that if it were possible for her to\n",
       "be happy during such a time, then she was happy. Little Fay completely\n",
       "filled a long aching void in her heart. In fettering the hands of this\n",
       "Lassiter she was accomplishing the greatest good of her life, and to do\n",
       "good even in a small way rendered happiness to Jane Withersteen. She had\n",
       "attended the regular Sunday services of her church; otherwise she had\n",
       "not gone to the village for weeks. It was unusual that none of her\n",
       "churchmen or friends had called upon her of late; but it was neglect\n",
       "for which she was glad. Judkins and his boy riders had experienced no\n",
       "difficulty in driving the white herd. So these warm July days were free\n",
       "of worry, and soon Jane hoped she had passed the crisis; and for her to\n",
       "hope was presently to trust, and then to believe. She thought often of\n",
       "Venters, but in a dreamy, abstract way. She spent hours teaching and\n",
       "playing with little Fay. And the activity of her mind centered around\n",
       "Lassiter. The direction she had given her will seemed to blunt any\n",
       "branching off of thought from that straight line. The mood came to\n",
       "obsess her.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the end, when her awakening came, she learned that she had builded\n",
       "better than she knew. Lassiter, though kinder and gentler than ever, had\n",
       "parted with his quaint humor and his coldness and his tranquillity to\n",
       "become a restless and unhappy man. Whatever the power of his deadly\n",
       "intent toward Mormons, that passion now had a rival, the one equally\n",
       "burning and consuming. Jane Withersteen had one moment of exultation\n",
       "before the dawn of a strange uneasiness. What if she had made of herself\n",
       "a lure, at tremendous cost to him and to her, and all in vain!\n",
       "\n",
       "That night in the moonlit grove she summoned all her courage and,\n",
       "turning suddenly in the path, she faced Lassiter and leaned close to\n",
       "him, so that she touched him and her eyes looked up to his.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter!... Will you do anything for me?”\n",
       "\n",
       "In the moonlight she saw his dark, worn face change, and by that change\n",
       "she seemed to feel him immovable as a wall of stone.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane slipped her hands down to the swinging gun-sheaths, and when she\n",
       "had locked her fingers around the huge, cold handles of the guns, she\n",
       "trembled as with a chilling ripple over all her body.\n",
       "\n",
       "“May I take your guns?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why?” he asked, and for the first time to her his voice carried a harsh\n",
       "note. Jane felt his hard, strong hands close round her wrists. It was\n",
       "not wholly with intent that she leaned toward him, for the look of his\n",
       "eyes and the feel of his hands made her weak.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's no trifle--no woman's whim--it's deep--as my heart. Let me take\n",
       "them?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I want to keep you from killing more men--Mormons. You must let me save\n",
       "you from more wickedness--more wanton bloodshed--” Then the truth forced\n",
       "itself falteringly from her lips. “You must--let--help me to keep my vow\n",
       "to Milly Erne. I swore to her--as she lay dying--that if ever any one\n",
       "came here to avenge her--I swore I would stay his hand. Perhaps I--I\n",
       "alone can save the--the man who--who--Oh, Lassiter!... I feel that I\n",
       "can't change you--then soon you'll be out to kill--and you'll kill\n",
       "by instinct--and among the Mormons you kill will be the\n",
       "one--who... Lassiter, if you care a little for me--let me--for my\n",
       "sake--let me take your guns!”\n",
       "\n",
       "As if her hands had been those of a child, he unclasped their clinging\n",
       "grip from the handles of his guns, and, pushing her away, he turned his\n",
       "gray face to her in one look of terrible realization and then strode off\n",
       "into the shadows of the cottonwoods.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the first shock of her futile appeal to Lassiter had passed, Jane\n",
       "took his cold, silent condemnation and abrupt departure not so much as a\n",
       "refusal to her entreaty as a hurt and stunned bitterness for her\n",
       "attempt at his betrayal. Upon further thought and slow consideration of\n",
       "Lassiter's past actions, she believed he would return and forgive her.\n",
       "The man could not be hard to a woman, and she doubted that he could\n",
       "stay away from her. But at the point where she had hoped to find him\n",
       "vulnerable she now began to fear he was proof against all persuasion.\n",
       "The iron and stone quality that she had early suspected in him had\n",
       "actually cropped out as an impregnable barrier. Nevertheless, if\n",
       "Lassiter remained in Cottonwoods she would never give up her hope and\n",
       "desire to change him. She would change him if she had to sacrifice\n",
       "everything dear to her except hope of heaven. Passionately devoted as\n",
       "she was to her religion, she had yet refused to marry a Mormon. But a\n",
       "situation had developed wherein self paled in the great white light of\n",
       "religious duty of the highest order. That was the leading motive,\n",
       "the divinely spiritual one; but there were other motives, which, like\n",
       "tentacles, aided in drawing her will to the acceptance of a possible\n",
       "abnegation. And through the watches of that sleepless night Jane\n",
       "Withersteen, in fear and sorrow and doubt, came finally to believe that\n",
       "if she must throw herself into Lassiter's arms to make him abide by\n",
       "“Thou shalt not kill!” she would yet do well.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the morning she expected Lassiter at the usual hour, but she was not\n",
       "able to go at once to the court, so she sent little Fay. Mrs. Larkin was\n",
       "ill and required attention. It appeared that the mother, from the time\n",
       "of her arrival at Withersteen House, had relaxed and was slowly\n",
       "losing her hold on life. Jane had believed that absence of worry and\n",
       "responsibility coupled with good nursing and comfort would mend Mrs.\n",
       "Larkin's broken health. Such, however, was not the case.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Jane did get out to the court, Fay was there alone, and at the\n",
       "moment embarking on a dubious voyage down the stone-lined amber stream\n",
       "upon a craft of two brooms and a pillow. Fay was as delightfully wet as\n",
       "she could possibly wish to get.\n",
       "\n",
       "Clatter of hoofs distracted Fay and interrupted the scolding she was\n",
       "gleefully receiving from Jane. The sound was not the light-spirited trot\n",
       "that Bells made when Lassiter rode him into the outer court. This was\n",
       "slower and heavier, and Jane did not recognize in it any of her other\n",
       "horses. The appearance of Bishop Dyer startled Jane. He dismounted with\n",
       "his rapid, jerky motion flung the bridle, and, as he turned toward the\n",
       "inner court and stalked up on the stone flags, his boots rang. In his\n",
       "authoritative front, and in the red anger unmistakably flaming in his\n",
       "face, he reminded Jane of her father.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Is that the Larkin pauper?” he asked, bruskly, without any greeting to\n",
       "Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's Mrs. Larkin's little girl,” replied Jane, slowly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I hear you intend to raise the child?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Of course you mean to give her Mormon bringing-up?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No.”\n",
       "\n",
       "His questions had been swift. She was amazed at a feeling that some one\n",
       "else was replying for her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I've come to say a few things to you.” He stopped to measure her with\n",
       "stern, speculative eye.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane Withersteen loved this man. From earliest childhood she had been\n",
       "taught to revere and love bishops of her church. And for ten years\n",
       "Bishop Dyer had been the closest friend and counselor of her father,\n",
       "and for the greater part of that period her own friend and Scriptural\n",
       "teacher. Her interpretation of her creed and her religious activity in\n",
       "fidelity to it, her acceptance of mysterious and holy Mormon truths,\n",
       "were all invested in this Bishop. Bishop Dyer as an entity was next\n",
       "to God. He was God's mouthpiece to the little Mormon community at\n",
       "Cottonwoods. God revealed himself in secret to this mortal.\n",
       "\n",
       "And Jane Withersteen suddenly suffered a paralyzing affront to her\n",
       "consciousness of reverence by some strange, irresistible twist of\n",
       "thought wherein she saw this Bishop as a man. And the train of thought\n",
       "hurdled the rising, crying protests of that other self whose poise she\n",
       "had lost. It was not her Bishop who eyed her in curious measurement. It\n",
       "was a man who tramped into her presence without removing his hat, who\n",
       "had no greeting for her, who had no semblance of courtesy. In looks,\n",
       "as in action, he made her think of a bull stamping cross-grained into a\n",
       "corral. She had heard of Bishop Dyer forgetting the minister in the fury\n",
       "of a common man, and now she was to feel it. The glance by which she\n",
       "measured him in turn momentarily veiled the divine in the ordinary.\n",

       "\n",
       "“For what--else?” When Bishop Dyer's voice did cleave the silence it was\n",

       "yet could not break the long and terrible silence. Then, from\n",
       "somewhere--from an immeasurable distance--came a slow, guarded,\n",
       "clinking, clanking step. Into her it shot electrifying life. It released\n",

       "shaken, stricken--not the Bishop but the man! And beyond him, from\n",
       "round the corner came that soft, silvery step. A long black boot with a\n",

       "ears burst a thundering report. The court floated in darkening circles\n",
       "around her, and she fell into utter blackness.\n",
       "\n",
       "The darkness lightened, turned to slow-drifting haze, and lifted.\n",
       "Through a thin film of blue smoke she saw the rough-hewn timbers of\n",
       "the court roof. A cool, damp touch moved across her brow. She smelled\n",
       "powder, and it was that which galvanized her suspended thought. She\n",
       "moved, to see that she lay prone upon the stone flags with her head on\n",
       "Lassiter's knee, and he was bathing her brow with water from the stream.\n",
       "The same swift glance, shifting low, brought into range of her sight a\n",
       "smoking gun and splashes of blood.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ah-h!” she moaned, and was drifting, sinking again into darkness, when\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "Jane received a letter from Bishop Dyer, not in his own handwriting,\n",
       "which stated that the abrupt termination of their interview had left\n",
       "him in some doubt as to her future conduct. A slight injury had\n",
       "incapacitated him from seeking another meeting at present, the letter\n",
       "went on to say, and ended with a request which was virtually a command,\n",
       "that she call upon him at once.\n",
       "\n",
       "The reading of the letter acquainted Jane Withersteen with the fact that\n",
       "something within her had all but changed. She sent no reply to Bishop\n",
       "Dyer nor did she go to see him. On Sunday she remained absent from the\n",
       "service--for the second time in years--and though she did not actually\n",
       "suffer there was a dead-lock of feelings deep within her, and the\n",
       "waiting for a balance to fall on either side was almost as bad as\n",
       "suffering. She had a gloomy expectancy of untoward circumstances,\n",
       "and with it a keen-edged curiosity to watch developments. She had\n",
       "a half-formed conviction that her future conduct--as related to her\n",
       "churchmen--was beyond her control and would be governed by their\n",
       "attitude toward her. Something was changing in her, forming, waiting for\n",
       "decision to make it a real and fixed thing. She had told Lassiter that\n",
       "she felt helpless and lost in the fateful tangle of their lives; and now\n",
       "she feared that she was approaching the same chaotic condition of mind\n",
       "in regard to her religion. It appalled her to find that she questioned\n",
       "phases of that religion. Absolute faith had been her serenity. Though\n",
       "leaving her faith unshaken, her serenity had been disturbed, and now\n",
       "it was broken by open war between her and her ministers. That something\n",
       "within her--a whisper--which she had tried in vain to hush had become\n",
       "a ringing voice, and it called to her to wait. She had transgressed\n",
       "no laws of God. Her churchmen, however invested with the power and the\n",
       "glory of a wonderful creed, however they sat in inexorable judgment of\n",
       "her, must now practice toward her the simple, common, Christian virtue\n",

       "Jane Withersteen, waiting in darkness of mind, remained faithful still.\n",

       "fact would soon be manifest, as would their failure, and then she would\n",
       "redouble her zeal toward them and toward what had been the best work\n",
       "of her life--work for the welfare and happiness of those among whom she\n",
       "lived, Mormon and Gentile alike. If that secret, intangible power closed\n",
       "its coils round her again, if that great invisible hand moved here and\n",
       "there and everywhere, slowly paralyzing her with its mystery and its\n",
       "inconceivable sway over her affairs, then she would know beyond doubt\n",
       "that it was not chance, nor jealousy, nor intimidation, nor ministerial\n",
       "wrath at her revolt, but a cold and calculating policy thought out long\n",
       "before she was born, a dark, immutable will of whose empire she and all\n",
       "that was hers was but an atom.\n",
       "\n",

       "watched with cool, roving eyes, that listened, listened always as if the\n",
       "murmuring amber stream brought messages, and the moving leaves whispered\n",
       "something. Lassiter never rode Bells into the court any more, nor did\n",
       "he come by the lane or the paths. When he appeared it was suddenly and\n",
       "noiselessly out of the dark shadow of the grove.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I left Bells out in the sage,” he said, one day at the end of that\n",
       "week. “I must carry water to him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why not let him drink at the trough or here?” asked Jane, quickly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon it'll be safer for me to slip through the grove. I've been\n",
       "watched when I rode in from the sage.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Watched? By whom?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“By a man who thought he was well hid. But my eyes are pretty sharp.\n",
       "An', Jane,” he went on, almost in a whisper, “I reckon it'd be a good\n",
       "idea for us to talk low. You're spied on here by your women.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter!” she whispered in turn. “That's hard to believe. My women\n",
       "love me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What of that?” he asked. “Of course they love you. But they're Mormon\n",

       "\n",
       "Jane's old, rebellious loyalty clashed with her doubt.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I won't believe it,” she replied, stubbornly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well then, just act natural an' talk natural, an' pretty soon--give\n",
       "them time to hear us--pretend to go over there to the table, en' then\n",
       "quick-like make a move for the door en' open it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I will,” said Jane, with heightened color. Lassiter was right; he never\n",
       "made mistakes; he would not have told her unless he positively knew. Yet\n",
       "Jane was so tenacious of faith that she had to see with her own eyes,\n",
       "and so constituted that to employ even such small deceit toward her\n",
       "women made her ashamed, and angry for her shame as well as theirs. Then\n",
       "a singular thought confronted her that made her hold up this simple\n",
       "ruse--which hurt her, though it was well justified--against the deceit\n",
       "she had wittingly and eagerly used toward Lassiter. The difference was\n",
       "staggering in its suggestion of that blindness of which he had accused\n",
       "her. Fairness and justice and mercy, that she had imagined were\n",
       "anchor-cables to hold fast her soul to righteousness had not been hers\n",
       "in the strange, biased duty that had so exalted and confounded her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Presently Jane began to act her little part, to laugh and play with\n",
       "Fay, to talk of horses and cattle to Lassiter. Then she made deliberate\n",
       "mention of a book in which she kept records of all pertaining to her\n",
       "stock, and she walked slowly toward the table, and when near the door\n",
       "she suddenly whirled and thrust it open. Her sharp action nearly knocked\n",
       "down a woman who had undoubtedly been listening.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hester,” said Jane, sternly, “you may go home, and you need not come\n",
       "back.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane shut the door and returned to Lassiter. Standing unsteadily, she\n",
       "put her hand on his arm. She let him see that doubt had gone, and how\n",
       "this stab of disloyalty pained her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Spies! My own women!... Oh, miserable!” she cried, with flashing,\n",
       "tearful eyes.\n",
       "\n",

       "So bitter certainty claimed her at last, and trust fled Withersteen\n",
       "House and fled forever. The women who owed much to Jane Withersteen\n",
       "changed not in love for her, nor in devotion to their household work,\n",
       "but they poisoned both by a thousand acts of stealth and cunning and\n",
       "duplicity. Jane broke out once and caught them in strange, stone-faced,\n",
       "unhesitating falsehood. Thereafter she broke out no more. She forgave\n",
       "them because they were driven. Poor, fettered, and sealed Hagars, how\n",
       "she pitied them! What terrible thing bound them and locked their\n",
       "lips, when they showed neither consciousness of guilt toward their\n",
       "benefactress nor distress at the slow wearing apart of long-established\n",
       "and dear ties?\n",
       "\n",
       "“The blindness again!” cried Jane Withersteen. “In my sisters as in\n",
       "me!... O God!”\n",
       "\n",
       "There came a time when no words passed between Jane and her women.\n",
       "Silently they went about their household duties, and secretly they went\n",
       "about the underhand work to which they had been bidden. The gloom of\n",
       "the house and the gloom of its mistress, which darkened even the bright\n",
       "spirit of little Fay, did not pervade these women. Happiness was not\n",
       "among them, but they were aloof from gloom. They spied and listened;\n",
       "they received and sent secret messengers; and they stole Jane's books\n",
       "and records, and finally the papers that were deeds of her possessions.\n",
       "Through it all they were silent, rapt in a kind of trance. Then one by\n",
       "one, without leave or explanation or farewell, they left Withersteen\n",
       "House, and never returned.\n",
       "\n",
       "Coincident with this disappearance Jane's gardeners and workers in the\n",
       "alfalfa fields and stable men quit her, not even asking for their wages.\n",
       "Of all her Mormon employees about the great ranch only Jerd remained. He\n",
       "went on with his duty, but talked no more of the change than if it had\n",
       "never occurred.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jerd,” said Jane, “what stock you can't take care of turn out in the\n",
       "sage. Let your first thought be for Black Star and Night. Keep them in\n",
       "perfect condition. Run them every day and watch them always.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Though Jane Withersteen gave them such liberality, she loved her\n",
       "possessions. She loved the rich, green stretches of alfalfa, and the\n",
       "farms, and the grove, and the old stone house, and the beautiful,\n",
       "ever-faithful amber spring, and every one of a myriad of horses and\n",
       "colts and burros and fowls down to the smallest rabbit that nipped her\n",
       "vegetables; but she loved best her noble Arabian steeds. In common with\n",
       "all riders of the upland sage Jane cherished two material things--the\n",
       "cold, sweet, brown water that made life possible in the wilderness and\n",
       "the horses which were a part of that life. When Lassiter asked her what\n",
       "Lassiter would be without his guns he was assuming that his horse was\n",
       "part of himself. So Jane loved Black Star and Night because it was her\n",
       "nature to love all beautiful creatures--perhaps all living things; and\n",
       "then she loved them because she herself was of the sage and in her\n",
       "had been born and bred the rider's instinct to rely on his four-footed\n",
       "brother. And when Jane gave Jerd the order to keep her favorites trained\n",
       "down to the day it was a half-conscious admission that presaged a time\n",
       "when she would need her fleet horses.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane had now, however, no leisure to brood over the coils that were\n",
       "closing round her. Mrs. Larkin grew weaker as the August days began;\n",
       "she required constant care; there was little Fay to look after; and such\n",
       "household work as was imperative. Lassiter put Bells in the stable with\n",
       "the other racers, and directed his efforts to a closer attendance upon\n",
       "Jane. She welcomed the change. He was always at hand to help, and it was\n",
       "her fortune to learn that his boast of being awkward around women had\n",
       "its root in humility and was not true.\n",
       "\n",
       "His great, brown hands were skilled in a multiplicity of ways which a\n",
       "woman might have envied. He shared Jane's work, and was of especial help\n",
       "to her in nursing Mrs. Larkin. The woman suffered most at night, and\n",
       "this often broke Jane's rest. So it came about that Lassiter would stay\n",
       "by Mrs. Larkin during the day, when she needed care, and Jane would make\n",
       "up the sleep she lost in night-watches. Mrs. Larkin at once took kindly\n",
       "to the gentle Lassiter, and, without ever asking who or what he was,\n",
       "praised him to Jane. “He's a good man and loves children,” she said. How\n",
       "sad to hear this truth spoken of a man whom Jane thought lost beyond all\n",
       "redemption! Yet ever and ever Lassiter towered above her, and behind\n",
       "or through his black, sinister figure shone something luminous that\n",
       "strangely affected Jane. Good and evil began to seem incomprehensibly\n",
       "blended in her judgment. It was her belief that evil could not come\n",
       "forth from good; yet here was a murderer who dwarfed in gentleness,\n",
       "patience, and love any man she had ever known.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had almost lost track of her more outside concerns when early one\n",
       "morning Judkins presented himself before her in the courtyard.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thin, hard, burnt, bearded, with the dust and sage thick on him, with\n",
       "his leather wrist-bands shining from use, and his boots worn through on\n",
       "the stirrup side, he looked the rider of riders. He wore two guns and\n",
       "carried a Winchester.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane greeted him with surprise and warmth, set meat and bread and\n",
       "drink before him; and called Lassiter out to see him. The men exchanged\n",
       "glances, and the meaning of Lassiter's keen inquiry and Judkins's bold\n",
       "reply, both unspoken, was not lost upon Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Where's your hoss?” asked Lassiter, aloud.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Left him down the slope,” answered Judkins. “I footed it in a ways, an'\n",
       "slept last night in the sage. I went to the place you told me you 'moss\n",
       "always slept, but didn't strike you.”\n",

       "“I moved up some, near the spring, an' now I go there nights.”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“Miss Withersteen, I make proud to say I've not lost a steer. Fer a good\n",
       "while after thet stampede Lassiter milled we hed no trouble. Why, even\n",
       "the sage dogs left us. But it's begun agin--thet flashin' of lights\n",
       "over ridge tips, an' queer puffin' of smoke, en' then at night strange\n",
       "whistles en' noises. But the herd's acted magnificent. An' my boys, say,\n",
       "Miss Withersteen, they're only kids, but I ask no better riders. I got\n",
       "the laugh in the village fer takin' them out. They're a wild lot, an'\n",
       "you know boys hev more nerve than grown men, because they don't know\n",
       "what danger is. I'm not denyin' there's danger. But they glory in it,\n",
       "an' mebbe I like it myself--anyway, we'll stick. We're goin' to drive\n",
       "the herd on the far side of the first break of Deception Pass. There's\n",
       "a great round valley over there, an' no ridges or piles of rocks to aid\n",
       "these stampeders. The rains are due. We'll hev plenty of water fer a\n",

       "\n",
       "Jane went to the room that had once been her father's, and from a secret\n",

       "back to the court, she gave it to the rider.\n",
       "\n",
       "“There, Judkins, and understand that I regard it as little for your\n",

       "“Judkins, you know I'm a rich woman. I tell you I've few faithful\n",

       "me and mine! So take the gold.”\n",
       "\n",
       "She smiled in understanding of his speechless gratitude, and left him\n",
       "with Lassiter. Presently she heard him speaking low at first, then in\n",
       "louder accents emphasized by the thumping of his rifle on the stones.\n",
       "“As infernal a job as even you, Lassiter, ever heerd of.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why, son,” was Lassiter's reply, “this breakin' of Miss Withersteen may\n",
       "seem bad to you, but it ain't bad--yet. Some of these wall-eyed fellers\n",
       "who look jest as if they was walkin' in the shadow of Christ himself,\n",
       "right down the sunny road, now they can think of things en' do things\n",
       "that are really hell-bent.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane covered her ears and ran to her own room, and there like caged\n",

       "dark thoughts.\n",
       "\n",
       "The following day, a warm and muggy one threatening rain awhile Jane was\n",
       "resting in the court, a horseman clattered through the grove and up to\n",
       "the hitching-rack. He leaped off and approached Jane with the manner\n",
       "of a man determined to execute difficult mission, yet fearful of its\n",
       "reception. In the gaunt, wiry figure and the lean, brown face Jane\n",
       "recognized one of her Mormon riders, Blake. It was he of whom Judkins\n",
       "had long since spoken. Of all the riders ever in her employ Blake owed\n",
       "her the most, and as he stepped before her, removing his hat and making\n",

       "thank God!... I've come to ride for you again, if you'll have me. Don't\n",
       "think I mentioned mother to get your sympathy. When she was living\n",
       "and your riders quit, I had to also. I was afraid of what might be\n",

       "not one was true. You've made it easy to forgive. Perhaps many of\n",

       "\n",
       "“Do it, then. If you're going to make your life a lesson to Mormon\n",

       "hoped it'd not be necessary to tell you that my mother on her deathbed\n",

       "\n",
       "“Well, if it pleases you,” replied Blake. “But you know I never thought\n",

       "\n",

       "to take me back. Now I don't know you; but I know--what you are. So\n",
       "I've this to say to your face. It would never occur to this woman to\n",
       "imagine--let alone suspect me to be a spy. She couldn't think it\n",
       "might just be a low plot to come here and shoot you in the back. Jane\n",
       "Withersteen hasn't that kind of a mind.... Well, I've not come for that.\n",

       "\n",
       "In his hidden valley Venters awakened from sleep, and his ears rang\n",
       "with innumerable melodies from full-throated mockingbirds, and his eyes\n",
       "opened wide upon the glorious golden shaft of sunlight shining through\n",
       "the great stone bridge. The circle of cliffs surrounding Surprise Valley\n",
       "lay shrouded in morning mist, a dim blue low down along the terraces,\n",
       "a creamy, moving cloud along the ramparts. The oak forest in the center\n",
       "was a plumed and tufted oval of gold.\n",
       "\n",
       "He saw Bess under the spruces. Upon her complete recovery of strength\n",
       "she always rose with the dawn. At the moment she was feeding the\n",
       "quail she had tamed. And she had begun to tame the mocking-birds. They\n",
       "fluttered among the branches overhead and some left off their songs to\n",
       "flit down and shyly hop near the twittering quail. Little gray and white\n",
       "rabbits crouched in the grass, now nibbling, now laying long ears flat\n",
       "and watching the dogs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters's swift glance took in the brightening valley, and Bess and her\n",
       "pets, and Ring and Whitie. It swept over all to return again and rest\n",
       "upon the girl. She had changed. To the dark trousers and blouse she had\n",
       "added moccasins of her own make, but she no longer resembled a boy.\n",
       "No eye could have failed to mark the rounded contours of a woman. The\n",
       "change had been to grace and beauty. A glint of warm gold gleamed from\n",
       "her hair, and a tint of red shone in the clear dark brown of cheeks. The\n",
       "haunting sweetness of her lips and eyes, that earlier had been illusive,\n",
       "a promise, had become a living fact. She fitted harmoniously into that\n",
       "wonderful setting; she was like Surprise Valley--wild and beautiful.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters leaped out of his cave to begin the day.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had postponed his journey to Cottonwoods until after the passing of\n",
       "the summer rains. The rains were due soon. But until their arrival and\n",
       "the necessity for his trip to the village he sequestered in a far corner\n",
       "of mind all thought of peril, of his past life, and almost that of the\n",
       "present. It was enough to live. He did not want to know what lay hidden\n",
       "in the dim and distant future. Surprise Valley had enchanted him. In\n",
       "this home of the cliff-dwellers there were peace and quiet and solitude,\n",
       "and another thing, wondrous as the golden morning shaft of sunlight,\n",
       "that he dared not ponder over long enough to understand.\n",
       "\n",
       "The solitude he had hated when alone he had now come to love. He was\n",
       "assimilating something from this valley of gleams and shadows. From this\n",
       "strange girl he was assimilating more.\n",
       "\n",
       "The day at hand resembled many days gone before. As Venters had no tools\n",
       "with which to build, or to till the terraces, he remained idle. Beyond\n",
       "the cooking of the simple fare there were no tasks. And as there were no\n",
       "tasks, there was no system. He and Bess began one thing, to leave it;\n",
       "to begin another, to leave that; and then do nothing but lie under the\n",
       "spruces and watch the great cloud-sails majestically move along the\n",
       "ramparts, and dream and dream. The valley was a golden, sunlit world.\n",
       "It was silent. The sighing wind and the twittering quail and the singing\n",
       "birds, even the rare and seldom-occurring hollow crack of a sliding\n",
       "weathered stone, only thickened and deepened that insulated silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters and Bess had vagrant minds.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess, did I tell you about my horse Wrangle?” inquired Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“A hundred times,” she replied.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, have I? I'd forgotten. I want you to see him. He'll carry us both.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'd like to ride him. Can he run?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Run? He's a demon. Swiftest horse on the sage! I hope he'll stay in\n",
       "that canyon.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He'll stay.”\n",
       "\n",
       "They left camp to wander along the terraces, into the aspen ravines,\n",
       "under the gleaming walls. Ring and Whitie wandered in the fore, often\n",
       "turning, often trotting back, open-mouthed and solemn-eyed and happy.\n",
       "Venters lifted his gaze to the grand archway over the entrance to\n",
       "the valley, and Bess lifted hers to follow his, and both were silent.\n",
       "Sometimes the bridge held their attention for a long time. To-day a\n",
       "soaring eagle attracted them.\n",
       "\n",
       "“How he sails!” exclaimed Bess. “I wonder where his mate is?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“She's at the nest. It's on the bridge in a crack near the top. I see\n",
       "her often. She's almost white.”\n",
       "\n",
       "They wandered on down the terrace, into the shady, sun-flecked forest.\n",
       "A brown bird fluttered crying from a bush. Bess peeped into the leaves.\n",
       "“Look! A nest and four little birds. They're not afraid of us. See how\n",
       "they open their mouths. They're hungry.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Rabbits rustled the dead brush and pattered away. The forest was full\n",
       "of a drowsy hum of insects. Little darts of purple, that were running\n",
       "quail, crossed the glades. And a plaintive, sweet peeping came from the\n",
       "coverts. Bess's soft step disturbed a sleeping lizard that scampered\n",
       "away over the leaves. She gave chase and caught it, a slim creature of\n",
       "nameless color but of exquisite beauty.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jewel eyes,” she said. “It's like a rabbit--afraid. We won't eat you.\n",
       "There--go.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Murmuring water drew their steps down into a shallow shaded ravine where\n",
       "a brown brook brawled softly over mossy stones. Multitudes of strange,\n",
       "gray frogs with white spots and black eyes lined the rocky bank and\n",
       "leaped only at close approach. Then Venters's eye descried a very thin,\n",
       "very long green snake coiled round a sapling. They drew closer and\n",
       "closer till they could have touched it. The snake had no fear and\n",
       "watched them with scintillating eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's pretty,” said Bess. “How tame! I thought snakes always ran.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No. Even the rabbits didn't run here till the dogs chased them.”\n",
       "\n",
       "On and on they wandered to the wild jumble of massed and broken\n",
       "fragments of cliff at the west end of the valley. The roar of the\n",
       "disappearing stream dinned in their ears. Into this maze of rocks they\n",
       "threaded a tortuous way, climbing, descending, halting to gather wild\n",
       "plums and great lavender lilies, and going on at the will of fancy. Idle\n",
       "and keen perceptions guided them equally.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, let us climb there!” cried Bess, pointing upward to a small space\n",
       "of terrace left green and shady between huge abutments of broken cliff.\n",
       "And they climbed to the nook and rested and looked out across the valley\n",
       "to the curling column of blue smoke from their campfire. But the cool\n",
       "shade and the rich grass and the fine view were not what they had\n",
       "climbed for. They could not have told, although whatever had drawn\n",
       "them was well-satisfying. Light, sure-footed as a mountain goat, Bess\n",
       "pattered down at Venters's heels; and they went on, calling the dogs,\n",
       "eyes dreamy and wide, listening to the wind and the bees and the\n",
       "crickets and the birds.\n",
       "\n",
       "Part of the time Ring and Whitie led the way, then Venters, then Bess;\n",
       "and the direction was not an object. They left the sun-streaked shade of\n",
       "the oaks, brushed the long grass of the meadows, entered the green\n",
       "and fragrant swaying willows, to stop, at length, under the huge old\n",
       "cottonwoods where the beavers were busy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here they rested and watched. A dam of brush and logs and mud and stones\n",
       "backed the stream into a little lake. The round, rough beaver houses\n",
       "projected from the water. Like the rabbits, the beavers had become shy.\n",
       "Gradually, however, as Venters and Bess knelt low, holding the dogs, the\n",
       "beavers emerged to swim with logs and gnaw at cottonwoods and pat mud\n",
       "walls with their paddle-like tails, and, glossy and shiny in the sun, to\n",
       "go on with their strange, persistent industry. They were the builders.\n",
       "The lake was a mud-hole, and the immediate environment a scarred and\n",
       "dead region, but it was a wonderful home of wonderful animals.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Look at that one--he puddles in the mud,” said Bess. “And there! See\n",
       "him dive! Hear them gnawing! I'd think they'd break their teeth. How's\n",
       "it they can stay out of the water and under the water?”\n",
       "\n",
       "And she laughed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Venters and Bess wandered farther, and, perhaps not all\n",
       "unconsciously this time, wended their slow steps to the cave of the\n",
       "cliff-dwellers, where she liked best to go.\n",
       "\n",
       "The tangled thicket and the long slant of dust and little chips of\n",
       "weathered rock and the steep bench of stone and the worn steps all\n",
       "were arduous work for Bess in the climbing. But she gained the shelf,\n",
       "gasping, hot of cheek, glad of eye, with her hand in Venters's. Here\n",
       "they rested. The beautiful valley glittered below with its millions\n",
       "of wind-turned leaves bright-faced in the sun, and the mighty bridge\n",
       "towered heavenward, crowned with blue sky. Bess, however, never rested\n",
       "for long. Soon she was exploring, and Venters followed; she dragged\n",
       "forth from corners and shelves a multitude of crudely fashioned and\n",
       "painted pieces of pottery, and he carried them. They peeped down into\n",
       "the dark holes of the kivas, and Bess gleefully dropped a stone and\n",
       "waited for the long-coming hollow sound to rise. They peeped into the\n",

       "lost her poise in happy confusion.\n",

       "“I'd better go right away,” he continued, “and fetch supplies from\n",
       "Cottonwoods.”\n",

       "\n",
       "The intense dead silence awakened to a long, low, rumbling roll of\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Venters and Bess finished their simple meal and the few tasks around the\n",

       "and await the approaching storm.\n",
       "\n",
       "It required keen vision to see any movement whatever in the purple\n",
       "clouds. By infinitesimal degrees the dark cloud-line merged upward into\n",
       "the golden-red haze of the afterglow of sunset. A shadow lengthened from\n",
       "under the western wall across the valley. As straight and rigid as steel\n",
       "rose the delicate spear-pointed silver spruces; the aspen leaves, by\n",
       "nature pendant and quivering, hung limp and heavy; no slender blade\n",
       "of grass moved. A gentle splashing of water came from the ravine. Then\n",
       "again from out of the west sounded the low, dull, and rumbling roll of\n",
       "thunder.\n",
       "\n",
       "A wave, a ripple of light, a trembling and turning of the aspen leaves,\n",
       "like the approach of a breeze on the water, crossed the valley from the\n",
       "west; and the lull and the deadly stillness and the sultry air passed\n",
       "away on a cool wind.\n",
       "\n",
       "The night bird of the canyon, with clear and melancholy notes announced\n",
       "the twilight. And from all along the cliffs rose the faint murmur and\n",
       "moan and mourn of the wind singing in the caves. The bank of clouds now\n",
       "swept hugely out of the western sky. Its front was purple and black,\n",
       "with gray between, a bulging, mushrooming, vast thing instinct with\n",
       "storm. It had a dark, angry, threatening aspect. As if all the power of\n",
       "the winds were pushing and piling behind, it rolled ponderously across\n",
       "the sky. A red flare burned out instantaneously, flashed from the west\n",
       "to east, and died. Then from the deepest black of the purple cloud burst\n",
       "a boom. It was like the bowling of a huge boulder along the crags and\n",
       "ramparts, and seemed to roll on and fall into the valley to bound and\n",
       "bang and boom from cliff to cliff.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh!” cried Bess, with her hands over her ears. “What did I tell you?”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“I'm a coward.”\n",

       "“Not quite that, I hope. It's strange you're afraid. I love a storm.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I tell you a storm down in these canyons is an awful thing. I know\n",
       "Oldring hated storms. His men were afraid of them. There was one who\n",
       "went deaf in a bad storm, and never could hear again.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Maybe I've lots to learn, Bess. I'll lose my guess if this storm isn't\n",
       "bad enough. We're going to have heavy wind first, then lightning and\n",
       "thunder, then the rain. Let's stay out as long as we can.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The tips of the cottonwoods and the oaks waved to the east, and the\n",
       "rings of aspens along the terraces twinkled their myriad of bright faces\n",
       "in fleet and glancing gleam. A low roar rose from the leaves of the\n",
       "forest, and the spruces swished in the rising wind. It came in gusts,\n",
       "with light breezes between. As it increased in strength the lulls\n",
       "shortened in length till there was a strong and steady blow all the\n",
       "time, and violent puffs at intervals, and sudden whirling currents. The\n",
       "clouds spread over the valley, rolling swiftly and low, and twilight\n",
       "faded into a sweeping darkness. Then the singing of the wind in the\n",
       "caves drowned the swift roar of rustling leaves; then the song swelled\n",
       "to a mourning, moaning wail; then with the gathering power of the\n",
       "wind the wail changed to a shriek. Steadily the wind strengthened and\n",
       "constantly the strange sound changed.\n",
       "\n",
       "The last bit of blue sky yielded to the on-sweep of clouds. Like angry\n",
       "surf the pale gleams of gray, amid the purple of that scudding front,\n",
       "swept beyond the eastern rampart of the valley. The purple deepened to\n",
       "black. Broad sheets of lightning flared over the western wall. There\n",
       "were not yet any ropes or zigzag streaks darting down through the\n",
       "gathering darkness. The storm center was still beyond Surprise Valley.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Listen!... Listen!” cried Bess, with her lips close to Venters's ear.\n",
       "“You'll hear Oldring's knell!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What's that?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oldring's knell. When the wind blows a gale in the caves it makes what\n",
       "the rustlers call Oldring's knell. They believe it bodes his death.\n",
       "I think he believes so, too. It's not like any sound on earth.... It's\n",
       "beginning. Listen!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The gale swooped down with a hollow unearthly howl. It yelled and pealed\n",
       "and shrilled and shrieked. It was made up of a thousand piercing cries.\n",
       "It was a rising and a moving sound. Beginning at the western break of\n",
       "the valley, it rushed along each gigantic cliff, whistling into the\n",
       "caves and cracks, to mount in power, to bellow a blast through the great\n",
       "stone bridge. Gone, as into an engulfing roar of surging waters, it\n",
       "seemed to shoot back and begin all over again.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was only wind, thought Venters. Here sped and shrieked the sculptor\n",
       "that carved out the wonderful caves in the cliffs. It was only a gale,\n",
       "but as Venters listened, as his ears became accustomed to the fury and\n",
       "strife, out of it all or through it or above it pealed low and perfectly\n",
       "clear and persistently uniform a strange sound that had no counterpart\n",
       "in all the sounds of the elements. It was not of earth or of life. It\n",
       "was the grief and agony of the gale. A knell of all upon which it blew!\n",
       "\n",
       "Black night enfolded the valley. Venters could not see his companion,\n",
       "and knew of her presence only through the tightening hold of her hand\n",
       "on his arm. He felt the dogs huddle closer to him. Suddenly the dense,\n",
       "black vault overhead split asunder to a blue-white, dazzling streak of\n",
       "lightning. The whole valley lay vividly clear and luminously bright in\n",
       "his sight. Upreared, vast and magnificent, the stone bridge glimmered\n",
       "like some grand god of storm in the lightning's fire. Then all flashed\n",
       "black again--blacker than pitch--a thick, impenetrable coal-blackness.\n",
       "And there came a ripping, crashing report. Instantly an echo resounded\n",
       "with clapping crash. The initial report was nothing to the echo. It was\n",
       "a terrible, living, reverberating, detonating crash. The wall threw the\n",
       "sound across, and could have made no greater roar if it had slipped\n",
       "in avalanche. From cliff to cliff the echo went in crashing retort and\n",
       "banged in lessening power, and boomed in thinner volume, and clapped\n",
       "weaker and weaker till a final clap could not reach across the waiting\n",
       "cliff.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the pitchy darkness Venters led Bess, and, groping his way, by feel\n",
       "of hand found the entrance to her cave and lifted her up. On the instant\n",
       "a blinding flash of lightning illumined the cave and all about him. He\n",
       "saw Bess's face white now with dark, frightened eyes. He saw the dogs\n",
       "leap up, and he followed suit. The golden glare vanished; all was black;\n",
       "then came the splitting crack and the infernal din of echoes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bess shrank closer to him and closer, found his hands, and pressed them\n",
       "tightly over her ears, and dropped her face upon his shoulder, and hid\n",
       "her eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then the storm burst with a succession of ropes and streaks and shafts\n",
       "of lightning, playing continuously, filling the valley with a broken\n",
       "radiance; and the cracking shots followed each other swiftly till the\n",
       "echoes blended in one fearful, deafening crash.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters looked out upon the beautiful valley--beautiful now as never\n",
       "before--mystic in its transparent, luminous gloom, weird in the\n",
       "quivering, golden haze of lightning. The dark spruces were tipped with\n",
       "glimmering lights; the aspens bent low in the winds, as waves in a\n",
       "tempest at sea; the forest of oaks tossed wildly and shone with gleams\n",
       "of fire. Across the valley the huge cavern of the cliff-dwellers yawned\n",
       "in the glare, every little black window as clear as at noonday; but the\n",
       "night and the storm added to their tragedy. Flung arching to the black\n",
       "clouds, the great stone bridge seemed to bear the brunt of the storm. It\n",
       "caught the full fury of the rushing wind. It lifted its noble crown to\n",
       "meet the lightnings. Venters thought of the eagles and their lofty nest\n",
       "in a niche under the arch. A driving pall of rain, black as the clouds,\n",
       "came sweeping on to obscure the bridge and the gleaming walls and the\n",
       "shining valley. The lightning played incessantly, streaking down through\n",
       "opaque darkness of rain. The roar of the wind, with its strange knell\n",
       "and the re-crashing echoes, mingled with the roar of the flooding rain,\n",
       "and all seemingly were deadened and drowned in a world of sound.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the dimming pale light Venters looked down upon the girl. She had\n",
       "sunk into his arms, upon his breast, burying her face. She clung to him.\n",
       "He felt the softness of her, and the warmth, and the quick heave of her\n",
       "breast. He saw the dark, slender, graceful outline of her form. A woman\n",
       "lay in his arms! And he held her closer. He who had been alone in the\n",
       "sad, silent watches of the night was not now and never must be again\n",
       "alone. He who had yearned for the touch of a hand felt the long tremble\n",
       "and the heart-beat of a woman. By what strange chance had she come to\n",
       "love him! By what change--by what marvel had she grown into a treasure!\n",
       "\n",
       "No more did he listen to the rush and roar of the thunder-storm.\n",
       "For with the touch of clinging hands and the throbbing bosom he grew\n",
       "conscious of an inward storm--the tingling of new chords of thought,\n",
       "strange music of unheard, joyous bells sad dreams dawning to wakeful\n",
       "delight, dissolving doubt, resurging hope, force, fire, and freedom,\n",
       "unutterable sweetness of desire. A storm in his breast--a storm of real\n",

       "strolled thoughtfully off alone along the terrace. He climbed a great\n",
       "yellow rock raising its crest among the spruces, and there he sat down\n",
       "to face the valley and the west.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I love her!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Aloud he spoke--unburdened his heart--confessed his secret. For an\n",

       "all about him whirled with tumult within.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Reviving memory of Jane Withersteen and thought of the complications of\n",
       "the present amazed him with proof of how far he had drifted from his\n",
       "old life. He discovered that he hated to take up the broken threads, to\n",
       "delve into dark problems and difficulties. In this beautiful valley he\n",
       "had been living a beautiful dream. Tranquillity had come to him, and the\n",
       "joy of solitude, and interest in all the wild creatures and crannies of\n",
       "this incomparable valley--and love. Under the shadow of the great stone\n",
       "bridge God had revealed Himself to Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“The world seems very far away,” he muttered, “but it's there--and I'm\n",
       "not yet done with it. Perhaps I never shall be.... Only--how glorious it\n",
       "would be to live here always and never think again!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Whereupon the resurging reality of the present, as if in irony of his\n",
       "wish, steeped him instantly in contending thought. Out of it all he\n",
       "presently evolved these things: he must go to Cottonwoods; he must bring\n",
       "supplies back to Surprise Valley; he must cultivate the soil and raise\n",
       "corn and stock, and, most imperative of all, he must decide the future\n",
       "of the girl who loved him and whom he loved. The first of these things\n",
       "required tremendous effort, the last one, concerning Bess, seemed simply\n",
       "and naturally easy of accomplishment. He would marry her. Suddenly, as\n",
       "from roots of poisonous fire, flamed up the forgotten truth concerning\n",
       "her. It seemed to wither and shrivel up all his joy on its hot, tearing\n",
       "way to his heart. She had been Oldring's Masked Rider. To Venters's\n",
       "question, “What were you to Oldring?” she had answered with scarlet\n",
       "shame and drooping head.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What do I care who she is or what she was!” he cried, passionately. And\n",
       "he knew it was not his old self speaking. It was this softer, gentler\n",
       "man who had awakened to new thoughts in the quiet valley. Tenderness,\n",
       "masterful in him now, matched the absence of joy and blunted the\n",
       "knife-edge of entering jealousy. Strong and passionate effort of will,\n",
       "surprising to him, held back the poison from piercing his soul.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Wait!... Wait!” he cried, as if calling. His hand pressed his breast,\n",
       "and he might have called to the pang there. “Wait! It's all so\n",
       "strange--so wonderful. Anything can happen. Who am I to judge her? I'll\n",
       "glory in my love for her. But I can't tell it--can't give up to it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Certainly he could not then decide her future. Marrying her was\n",
       "impossible in Surprise Valley and in any village south of Sterling. Even\n",
       "without the mask she had once worn she would easily have been recognized\n",
       "as Oldring's Rider. No man who had ever seen her would forget her,\n",
       "regardless of his ignorance as to her sex. Then more poignant than all\n",
       "other argument was the fact that he did not want to take her away from\n",
       "Surprise Valley. He resisted all thought of that. He had brought her to\n",
       "the most beautiful and wildest place of the uplands; he had saved her,\n",
       "nursed her back to strength, watched her bloom as one of the valley\n",
       "lilies; he knew her life there to be pure and sweet--she belonged to\n",
       "him, and he loved her. Still these were not all the reasons why he\n",
       "did not want to take her away. Where could they go? He feared the\n",
       "rustlers--he feared the riders--he feared the Mormons. And if he should\n",
       "ever succeed in getting Bess safely away from these immediate perils, he\n",
       "feared the sharp eyes of women and their tongues, the big outside world\n",
       "with its problems of existence. He must wait to decide her future,\n",
       "which, after all, was deciding his own. But between her future and his\n",
       "something hung impending. Like Balancing Rock, which waited darkly over\n",
       "the steep gorge, ready to close forever the outlet to Deception Pass,\n",
       "that nameless thing, as certain yet intangible as fate, must fall and\n",
       "close forever all doubts and fears of the future.\n",
       "\n",

       "climes, of sunshine asleep on other walls--of other places where reigned\n",
       "peace. It carried, too, sad truth of human hearts and mystery--of\n",

       "\n",
       "In the cloudy, threatening, waning summer days shadows lengthened\n",
       "down the sage-slope, and Jane Withersteen likened them to the shadows\n",
       "gathering and closing in around her life.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Larkin died, and little Fay was left an orphan with no known\n",
       "relative. Jane's love redoubled. It was the saving brightness of a\n",
       "darkening hour. Fay turned now to Jane in childish worship. And Jane\n",
       "at last found full expression for the mother-longing in her heart. Upon\n",
       "Lassiter, too, Mrs. Larkin's death had some subtle reaction. Before,\n",
       "he had often, without explanation, advised Jane to send Fay back to any\n",
       "Gentile family that would take her in. Passionately and reproachfully\n",
       "and wonderingly Jane had refused even to entertain such an idea. And\n",
       "now Lassiter never advised it again, grew sadder and quieter in his\n",
       "contemplation of the child, and infinitely more gentle and loving.\n",
       "Sometimes Jane had a cold, inexplicable sensation of dread when she saw\n",
       "Lassiter watching Fay. What did the rider see in the future? Why did he,\n",
       "day by day, grow more silent, calmer, cooler, yet sadder in prophetic\n",
       "assurance of something to be?\n",
       "\n",
       "No doubt, Jane thought, the rider, in his almost superhuman power of\n",
       "foresight, saw behind the horizon the dark, lengthening shadows that\n",
       "were soon to crowd and gloom over him and her and little Fay. Jane\n",
       "Withersteen awaited the long-deferred breaking of the storm with a\n",
       "courage and embittered calm that had come to her in her extremity. Hope\n",
       "had not died. Doubt and fear, subservient to her will, no longer gave\n",
       "her sleepless nights and tortured days. Love remained. All that she had\n",
       "loved she now loved the more. She seemed to feel that she was defiantly\n",
       "flinging the wealth of her love in the face of misfortune and of\n",
       "hate. No day passed but she prayed for all--and most fervently for her\n",
       "enemies. It troubled her that she had lost, or had never gained,\n",
       "the whole control of her mind. In some measure reason and wisdom and\n",
       "decision were locked in a chamber of her brain, awaiting a key. Power\n",
       "to think of some things was taken from her. Meanwhile, abiding a day of\n",
       "judgment, she fought ceaselessly to deny the bitter drops in her cup,\n",
       "to tear back the slow, the intangibly slow growth of a hot, corrosive\n",
       "lichen eating into her heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the morning of August 10th, Jane, while waiting in the court for\n",
       "Lassiter, heard a clear, ringing report of a rifle. It came from the\n",
       "grove, somewhere toward the corrals. Jane glanced out in alarm. The day\n",
       "was dull, windless, soundless. The leaves of the cottonwoods drooped, as\n",
       "if they had foretold the doom of Withersteen House and were now ready to\n",
       "die and drop and decay. Never had Jane seen such shade. She pondered\n",
       "on the meaning of the report. Revolver shots had of late cracked from\n",
       "different parts of the grove--spies taking snap-shots at Lassiter from\n",
       "a cowardly distance! But a rifle report meant more. Riders seldom used\n",
       "rifles. Judkins and Venters were the exceptions she called to mind. Had\n",
       "the men who hounded her hidden in her grove, taken to the rifle to rid\n",
       "her of Lassiter, her last friend? It was probable--it was likely. And\n",
       "she did not share his cool assumption that his death would never come at\n",
       "the hands of a Mormon. Long had she expected it. His constancy to\n",
       "her, his singular reluctance to use the fatal skill for which he was\n",
       "famed--both now plain to all Mormons--laid him open to inevitable\n",
       "assassination. Yet what charm against ambush and aim and enemy he\n",
       "seemed to bear about him! No, Jane reflected, it was not charm; only\n",
       "a wonderful training of eye and ear, and sense of impending peril.\n",
       "Nevertheless that could not forever avail against secret attack.\n",
       "\n",
       "That moment a rustling of leaves attracted her attention; then the\n",
       "familiar clinking accompaniment of a slow, soft, measured step, and\n",
       "Lassiter walked into the court.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, there's a fellow out there with a long gun,” he said, and,\n",
       "removing his sombrero, showed his head bound in a bloody scarf.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I heard the shot; I knew it was meant for you. Let me see--you can't be\n",
       "badly injured?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon not. But mebbe it wasn't a close call!... I'll sit here in this\n",
       "corner where nobody can see me from the grove.” He untied the scarf and\n",
       "removed it to show a long, bleeding furrow above his left temple.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's only a cut,” said Jane. “But how it bleeds! Hold your scarf over\n",
       "it just a moment till I come back.”\n",
       "\n",
       "She ran into the house and returned with bandages; and while she bathed\n",
       "and dressed the wound Lassiter talked.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That fellow had a good chance to get me. But he must have flinched when\n",
       "he pulled the trigger. As I dodged down I saw him run through the trees.\n",
       "He had a rifle. I've been expectin' that kind of gun play. I reckon now\n",
       "I'll have to keep a little closer hid myself. These fellers all seem to\n",
       "get chilly or shaky when they draw a bead on me, but one of them might\n",
       "jest happen to hit me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Won't you go away--leave Cottonwoods as I've begged you to--before some\n",
       "one does happen to hit you?” she appealed to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon I'll stay.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“But, oh, Lassiter--your blood will be on my hands!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“See here, lady, look at your hands now, right now. Aren't they fine,\n",
       "firm, white hands? Aren't they bloody now? Lassiter's blood! That's a\n",
       "queer thing to stain your beautiful hands. But if you could only see\n",
       "deeper you'd find a redder color of blood. Heart color, Jane!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh!... My friend!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, Jane, I'm not one to quit when the game grows hot, no more than\n",
       "you. This game, though, is new to me, an' I don't know the moves yet,\n",
       "else I wouldn't have stepped in front of that bullet.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Have you no desire to hunt the man who fired at you--to find\n",
       "him--and--and kill him?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, I reckon I haven't any great hankerin' for that.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, the wonder of it!... I knew--I prayed--I trusted. Lassiter, I almost\n",
       "gave--all myself to soften you to Mormons. Thank God, and thank you, my\n",
       "friend.... But, selfish woman that I am, this is no great test. What's\n",
       "the life of one of those sneaking cowards to such a man as you? I think\n",
       "of your great hate toward him who--I think of your life's implacable\n",
       "purpose. Can it be--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Wait!... Listen!” he whispered. “I hear a hoss.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He rose noiselessly, with his ear to the breeze. Suddenly he pulled his\n",
       "sombrero down over his bandaged head and, swinging his gun-sheaths round\n",
       "in front, he stepped into the alcove.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's a hoss--comin' fast,” he added.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane's listening ear soon caught a faint, rapid, rhythmic beat of hoofs.\n",
       "It came from the sage. It gave her a thrill that she was at a loss to\n",
       "understand. The sound rose stronger, louder. Then came a clear, sharp\n",
       "difference when the horse passed from the sage trail to the hard-packed\n",
       "ground of the grove. It became a ringing run--swift in its bell-like\n",
       "clatterings, yet singular in longer pause than usual between the\n",
       "hoofbeats of a horse.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's Wrangle!... It's Wrangle!” cried Jane Withersteen. “I'd know him\n",
       "from a million horses!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Excitement and thrilling expectancy flooded out all Jane Withersteen's\n",
       "calm. A tight band closed round her breast as she saw the giant sorrel\n",
       "flit in reddish-brown flashes across the openings in the green. Then\n",
       "he was pounding down the lane--thundering into the court--crashing his\n",
       "great iron-shod hoofs on the stone flags. Wrangle it was surely, but\n",
       "shaggy and wild-eyed, and sage-streaked, with dust-caked lather staining\n",
       "his flanks. He reared and crashed down and plunged. The rider leaped\n",
       "off, threw the bridle, and held hard on a lasso looped round Wrangle's\n",
       "head and neck. Janet's heart sank as she tried to recognize Venters in\n",
       "the rider. Something familiar struck her in the lofty stature in the\n",
       "sweep of powerful shoulders. But this bearded, longhaired, unkempt man,\n",
       "who wore ragged clothes patched with pieces of skin, and boots that\n",
       "showed bare legs and feet--this dusty, dark, and wild rider could not\n",
       "possibly be Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Whoa, Wrangle, old boy! Come down. Easy now. So--so--so. You're home,\n",
       "old boy, and presently you can have a drink of water you'll remember.”\n",
       "\n",
       "In the voice Jane knew the rider to be Venters. He tied Wrangle to the\n",
       "hitching-rack and turned to the court.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, Bern!... You wild man!” she exclaimed.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane--Jane, it's good to see you! Hello, Lassiter! Yes, it's Venters.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Like rough iron his hard hand crushed Jane's. In it she felt the\n",
       "difference she saw in him. Wild, rugged, unshorn--yet how splendid! He\n",
       "had gone away a boy--he had returned a man. He appeared taller, wider of\n",
       "shoulder, deeper-chested, more powerfully built. But was that only her\n",
       "fancy--he had always been a young giant--was the change one of spirit?\n",
       "He might have been absent for years, proven by fire and steel, grown\n",
       "like Lassiter, strong and cool and sure. His eyes--were they keener,\n",
       "more flashing than before?--met hers with clear, frank, warm regard, in\n",
       "which perplexity was not, nor discontent, nor pain.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Look at me long as you like,” he said, with a laugh. “I'm not much to\n",
       "look at. And, Jane, neither you nor Lassiter, can brag. You're paler\n",
       "than I ever saw you. Lassiter, here, he wears a bloody bandage under\n",
       "his hat. That reminds me. Some one took a flying shot at me down in the\n",
       "sage. It made Wrangle run some.... Well, perhaps you've more to tell me\n",
       "than I've got to tell you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Briefly, in few words, Jane outlined the circumstances of her undoing in\n",
       "the weeks of his absence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Under his beard and bronze she saw his face whiten in terrible wrath.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter--what held you back?”\n",
       "\n",
       "No time in the long period of fiery moments and sudden shocks had Jane\n",
       "Withersteen ever beheld Lassiter as calm and serene and cool as then.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane had gloom enough without my addin' to it by shootin' up the\n",
       "village,” he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "As strange as Lassiter's coolness was Venters's curious, intent scrutiny\n",
       "of them both, and under it Jane felt a flaming tide wave from bosom to\n",
       "temples.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well--you're right,” he said, with slow pause. “It surprises me a\n",
       "little, that's all.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane sensed then a slight alteration in Venters, and what it was, in her\n",
       "own confusion, she could not tell. It had always been her intention\n",
       "to acquaint him with the deceit she had fallen to in her zeal to move\n",
       "Lassiter. She did not mean to spare herself. Yet now, at the moment,\n",
       "before these riders, it was an impossibility to explain.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters was speaking somewhat haltingly, without his former frankness.\n",
       "“I found Oldring's hiding-place and your red herd. I learned--I\n",
       "know--I'm sure there was a deal between Tull and Oldring.” He paused\n",
       "and shifted his position and his gaze. He looked as if he wanted to say\n",
       "something that he found beyond him. Sorrow and pity and shame seemed\n",
       "to contend for mastery over him. Then he raised himself and spoke with\n",
       "effort. “Jane I've cost you too much. You've almost ruined yourself\n",
       "for me. It was wrong, for I'm not worth it. I never deserved such\n",
       "friendship. Well, maybe it's not too late. You must give me up. Mind,\n",
       "I haven't changed. I am just the same as ever. I'll see Tull while I'm\n",
       "here, and tell him to his face.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern, it's too late,” said Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'll make him believe!” cried Venters, violently.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You ask me to break our friendship?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes. If you don't, I shall.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Forever?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Forever!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane sighed. Another shadow had lengthened down the sage slope to\n",
       "cast further darkness upon her. A melancholy sweetness pervaded her\n",
       "resignation. The boy who had left her had returned a man, nobler,\n",
       "stronger, one in whom she divined something unbending as steel. There\n",
       "might come a moment later when she would wonder why she had not fought\n",
       "against his will, but just now she yielded to it. She liked him as\n",
       "well--nay, more, she thought, only her emotions were deadened by the\n",
       "long, menacing wait for the bursting storm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once before she had held out her hand to him--when she gave it; now she\n",
       "stretched it tremblingly forth in acceptance of the decree circumstance\n",
       "had laid upon them. Venters bowed over it kissed it, pressed it hard,\n",
       "and half stifled a sound very like a sob. Certain it was that when he\n",
       "raised his head tears glistened in his eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Some--women--have a hard lot,” he said, huskily. Then he shook his\n",
       "powerful form, and his rags lashed about him. “I'll say a few things to\n",
       "Tull--when I meet him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern--you'll not draw on Tull? Oh, that must not be! Promise me--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I promise you this,” he interrupted, in stern passion that thrilled\n",
       "while it terrorized her. “If you say one more word for that plotter I'll\n",
       "kill him as I would a mad coyote!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane clasped her hands. Was this fire-eyed man the one whom she had\n",
       "once made as wax to her touch? Had Venters become Lassiter and Lassiter\n",
       "Venters?\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'll--say no more,” she faltered.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, Lassiter once called you blind,” said Venters. “It must be true.\n",
       "But I won't upbraid you. Only don't rouse the devil in me by praying for\n",
       "Tull! I'll try to keep cool when I meet him. That's all. Now there's one\n",
       "more thing I want to ask of you--the last. I've found a valley down in\n",
       "the Pass. It's a wonderful place. I intend to stay there. It's so hidden\n",
       "I believe no one can find it. There's good water, and browse, and game.\n",
       "I want to raise corn and stock. I need to take in supplies. Will you\n",
       "give them to me?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Assuredly. The more you take the better you'll please me--and perhaps\n",
       "the less my--my enemies will get.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Venters, I reckon you'll have trouble packin' anythin' away,” put in\n",
       "Lassiter.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'll go at night.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Mebbe that wouldn't be best. You'd sure be stopped. You'd better go\n",
       "early in the mornin'--say, just after dawn. That's the safest time to\n",
       "move round here.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, I'll be hard to stop,” returned Venters, darkly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon so.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern,” said Jane, “go first to the riders' quarters and get yourself a\n",
       "complete outfit. You're a--a sight. Then help yourself to whatever else\n",
       "you need--burros, packs, grain, dried fruits, and meat. You must take\n",
       "coffee and sugar and flour--all kinds of supplies. Don't forget corn and\n",
       "seeds. I remember how you used to starve. Please--please take all you\n",
       "can pack away from here. I'll make a bundle for you, which you mustn't\n",
       "open till you're in your valley. How I'd like to see it! To judge by you\n",
       "and Wrangle, how wild it must be!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane walked down into the outer court and approached the sorrel.\n",
       "Upstarting, he laid back his ears and eyed her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Wrangle--dear old Wrangle,” she said, and put a caressing hand on his\n",
       "matted mane. “Oh, he's wild, but he knows me! Bern, can he run as fast\n",
       "as ever?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Run? Jane, he's done sixty miles since last night at dark, and I could\n",
       "make him kill Black Star right now in a ten-mile race.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“He never could,” protested Jane. “He couldn't even if he was fresh.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon mebbe the best hoss'll prove himself yet,” said Lassiter,\n",
       "“an', Jane, if it ever comes to that race I'd like you to be on\n",
       "Wrangle.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'd like that, too,” rejoined Venters. “But, Jane, maybe Lassiter's\n",
       "hint is extreme. Bad as your prospects are, you'll surely never come to\n",
       "the running point.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Who knows!” she replied, with mournful smile.\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, no, Jane, it can't be so bad as all that. Soon as I see Tull\n",
       "there'll be a change in your fortunes. I'll hurry down to the\n",
       "village.... Now don't worry.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane retired to the seclusion of her room. Lassiter's subtle forecasting\n",
       "of disaster, Venters's forced optimism, neither remained in mind.\n",
       "Material loss weighed nothing in the balance with other losses she\n",
       "was sustaining. She wondered dully at her sitting there, hands folded\n",
       "listlessly, with a kind of numb deadness to the passing of time and the\n",
       "passing of her riches. She thought of Venters's friendship. She had not\n",
       "lost that, but she had lost him. Lassiter's friendship--that was more\n",
       "than love--it would endure, but soon he, too, would be gone. Little\n",
       "Fay slept dreamlessly upon the bed, her golden curls streaming over the\n",
       "pillow. Jane had the child's worship. Would she lose that, too? And if\n",
       "she did, what then would be left? Conscience thundered at her that there\n",
       "was left her religion. Conscience thundered that she should be grateful\n",
       "on her knees for this baptism of fire; that through misfortune,\n",
       "sacrifice, and suffering her soul might be fused pure gold. But the old,\n",
       "spontaneous, rapturous spirit no more exalted her. She wanted to be a\n",
       "woman--not a martyr. Like the saint of old who mortified his flesh,\n",
       "Jane Withersteen had in her the temper for heroic martyrdom, if by\n",
       "sacrificing herself she could save the souls of others. But here the\n",
       "damnable verdict blistered her that the more she sacrificed herself the\n",

       "presently developed that Lassiter had returned in a mood of singular\n",
       "sadness and preoccupation. She put it down to a moodiness over the loss\n",
       "of her white herd and the now precarious condition of her fortune.\n",
       "\n",
       "Several days passed, and as nothing happened, Jane's spirits began to\n",
       "brighten. Once in her musings she thought that this tendency of hers\n",
       "to rebound was as sad as it was futile. Meanwhile, she had resumed her\n",
       "walks through the grove with little Fay.\n",
       "\n",
       "One morning she went as far as the sage. She had not seen the slope\n",
       "since the beginning of the rains, and now it bloomed a rich deep purple.\n",
       "There was a high wind blowing, and the sage tossed and waved and colored\n",
       "beautifully from light to dark. Clouds scudded across the sky and their\n",
       "shadows sailed darkly down the sunny slope.\n",
       "\n",
       "Upon her return toward the house she went by the lane to the stables,\n",
       "and she had scarcely entered the great open space with its corrals and\n",
       "sheds when she saw Lassiter hurriedly approaching. Fay broke from her\n",
       "and, running to a corral fence, began to pat and pull the long, hanging\n",
       "ears of a drowsy burro.\n",
       "\n",
       "One look at Lassiter armed her for a blow.\n",
       "\n",
       "Without a word he led her across the wide yard to the rise of the ground\n",
       "upon which the stable stood.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane--look!” he said, and pointed to the ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane glanced down, and again, and upon steadier vision made out\n",
       "splotches of blood on the stones, and broad, smooth marks in the dust,\n",
       "leading out toward the sage.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What made these?” she asked.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon somebody has dragged dead or wounded men out to where there\n",
       "was hosses in the sage.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Dead--or--wounded--men!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon--Jane, are you strong? Can you bear up?”\n",
       "\n",
       "His hands were gently holding hers, and his eyes--suddenly she could no\n",
       "longer look into them. “Strong?” she echoed, trembling. “I--I will be.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Up on the stone-flag drive, nicked with the marks made by the iron-shod\n",
       "hoofs of her racers, Lassiter led her, his grasp ever growing firmer.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Where's Blake--and--and Jerb?” she asked, haltingly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I don't know where Jerb is. Bolted, most likely,” replied Lassiter, as\n",
       "he took her through the stone door. “But Blake--poor Blake! He's gone\n",
       "forever!... Be prepared, Jane.”\n",
       "\n",
       "With a cold prickling of her skin, with a queer thrumming in her ears,\n",
       "with fixed and staring eyes, Jane saw a gun lying at her feet with\n",
       "chamber swung and empty, and discharged shells scattered near.\n",
       "\n",
       "Outstretched upon the stable floor lay Blake, ghastly white--dead--one\n",
       "hand clutching a gun and the other twisted in his bloody blouse.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Whoever the thieves were, whether your people or rustlers--Blake killed\n",
       "some of them!” said Lassiter.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Thieves?” whispered Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon. Hoss-thieves!... Look!” Lassiter waved his hand toward the\n",
       "stalls.\n",
       "\n",
       "The first stall--Bells's stall--was empty. All the stalls were empty. No\n",

       "\n",
       "As Lassiter had reported to Jane, Venters “went through” safely, and\n",
       "after a toilsome journey reached the peaceful shelter of Surprise\n",
       "Valley. When finally he lay wearily down under the silver spruces,\n",
       "resting from the strain of dragging packs and burros up the slope and\n",
       "through the entrance to Surprise Valley, he had leisure to think, and\n",
       "a great deal of the time went in regretting that he had not been frank\n",
       "with his loyal friend, Jane Withersteen.\n",
       "\n",
       "But, he kept continually recalling, when he had stood once more face to\n",
       "face with her and had been shocked at the change in her and had heard\n",
       "the details of her adversity, he had not had the heart to tell her of\n",
       "the closer interest which had entered his life. He had not lied; yet he\n",
       "had kept silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bess was in transports over the stores of supplies and the outfit he had\n",
       "packed from Cottonwoods. He had certainly brought a hundred times\n",
       "more than he had gone for; enough, surely, for years, perhaps to make\n",
       "permanent home in the valley. He saw no reason why he need ever leave\n",
       "there again.\n",
       "\n",
       "After a day of rest he recovered his strength and shared Bess's pleasure\n",
       "in rummaging over the endless packs, and began to plan for the future.\n",
       "And in this planning, his trip to Cottonwoods, with its revived hate\n",
       "of Tull and consequent unleashing of fierce passions, soon faded out\n",
       "of mind. By slower degrees his friendship for Jane Withersteen and his\n",
       "contrition drifted from the active preoccupation of his present thought\n",
       "to a place in memory, with more and more infrequent recalls.\n",
       "\n",
       "And as far as the state of his mind was concerned, upon the second day\n",
       "after his return, the valley, with its golden hues and purple shades,\n",
       "the speaking west wind and the cool, silent night, and Bess's watching\n",
       "eyes with their wonderful light, so wrought upon Venters that he might\n",
       "never have left them at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "That very afternoon he set to work. Only one thing hindered him upon\n",
       "beginning, though it in no wise checked his delight, and that in the\n",
       "multiplicity of tasks planned to make a paradise out of the valley he\n",
       "could not choose the one with which to begin. He had to grow into the\n",
       "habit of passing from one dreamy pleasure to another, like a bee going\n",
       "from flower to flower in the valley, and he found this wandering habit\n",
       "likely to extend to his labors. Nevertheless, he made a start.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the outset he discovered Bess to be both a considerable help in some\n",
       "ways and a very great hindrance in others. Her excitement and joy were\n",
       "spurs, inspirations; but she was utterly impracticable in her ideas,\n",
       "and she flitted from one plan to another with bewildering vacillation.\n",
       "Moreover, he fancied that she grew more eager, youthful, and sweet; and\n",
       "he marked that it was far easier to watch her and listen to her than\n",
       "it was to work. Therefore he gave her tasks that necessitated her going\n",
       "often to the cave where he had stored his packs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Upon the last of these trips, when he was some distance down the terrace\n",
       "and out of sight of camp, he heard a scream, and then the sharp barking\n",
       "of the dogs.\n",
       "\n",
       "For an instant he straightened up, amazed. Danger for her had been\n",
       "absolutely out of his mind. She had seen a rattlesnake--or a wildcat.\n",
       "Still she would not have been likely to scream at sight of either; and\n",
       "the barking of the dogs was ominous. Dropping his work, he dashed back\n",
       "along the terrace. Upon breaking through a clump of aspens he saw the\n",
       "dark form of a man in the camp. Cold, then hot, Venters burst into\n",
       "frenzied speed to reach his guns. He was cursing himself for a\n",
       "thoughtless fool when the man's tall form became familiar and he\n",
       "recognized Lassiter. Then the reversal of emotions changed his run to\n",
       "a walk; he tried to call out, but his voice refused to carry; when he\n",
       "reached camp there was Lassiter staring at the white-faced girl. By that\n",
       "time Ring and Whitie had recognized him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hello, Venters! I'm makin' you a visit,” said Lassiter, slowly. “An'\n",
       "I'm some surprised to see you've a--a young feller for company.”\n",
       "\n",
       "One glance had sufficed for the keen rider to read Bess's real sex, and\n",
       "for once his cool calm had deserted him. He stared till the white of\n",
       "Bess's cheeks flared into crimson. That, if it were needed, was the\n",
       "concluding evidence of her femininity, for it went fittingly with her\n",
       "sun-tinted hair and darkened, dilated eyes, the sweetness of her mouth,\n",
       "and the striking symmetry of her slender shape.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Heavens! Lassiter!” panted Venters, when he caught his breath. “What\n",
       "relief--it's only you! How--in the name of all that's wonderful--did you\n",
       "ever get here?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I trailed you. We--I wanted to know where you was, if you had a safe\n",
       "place. So I trailed you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Trailed me,” cried Venters, bluntly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon. It was some of a job after I got to them smooth rocks. I was\n",
       "all day trackin' you up to them little cut steps in the rock. The rest\n",
       "was easy.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Where's your hoss? I hope you hid him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I tied him in them queer cedars down on the slope. He can't be seen\n",
       "from the valley.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“That's good. Well, well! I'm completely dumfounded. It was my idea that\n",
       "no man could track me in here.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon. But if there's a tracker in these uplands as good as me he\n",
       "can find you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“That's bad. That'll worry me. But, Lassiter, now you're here I'm glad\n",
       "to see you. And--and my companion here is not a young fellow!... Bess,\n",
       "this is a friend of mine. He saved my life once.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The embarrassment of the moment did not extend to Lassiter. Almost at\n",
       "once his manner, as he shook hands with Bess, relieved Venters and put\n",
       "the girl at ease. After Venters's words and one quick look at Lassiter,\n",
       "her agitation stilled, and, though she was shy, if she were conscious\n",
       "of anything out of the ordinary in the situation, certainly she did not\n",
       "show it.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon I'll only stay a little while,” Lassiter was saying. “An' if\n",
       "you don't mind troublin', I'm hungry. I fetched some biscuits along, but\n",
       "they're gone. Venters, this place is sure the wonderfullest ever seen.\n",
       "Them cut steps on the slope! That outlet into the gorge! An' it's like\n",
       "climbin' up through hell into heaven to climb through that gorge into\n",
       "this valley! There's a queer-lookin' rock at the top of the passage. I\n",
       "didn't have time to stop. I'm wonderin' how you ever found this place.\n",
       "It's sure interestin'.”\n",
       "\n",
       "During the preparation and eating of dinner Lassiter listened mostly,\n",
       "as was his wont, and occasionally he spoke in his quaint and dry way.\n",
       "Venters noted, however, that the rider showed an increasing interest in\n",
       "Bess. He asked her no questions, and only directed his attention to her\n",
       "while she was occupied and had no opportunity to observe his scrutiny.\n",
       "It seemed to Venters that Lassiter grew more and more absorbed in his\n",
       "study of Bess, and that he lost his coolness in some strange, softening\n",
       "sympathy. Then, quite abruptly, he arose and announced the necessity\n",
       "for his early departure. He said good-by to Bess in a voice gentle and\n",
       "somewhat broken, and turned hurriedly away. Venters accompanied him, and\n",
       "they had traversed the terrace, climbed the weathered slope, and passed\n",
       "under the stone bridge before either spoke again.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Lassiter put a great hand on Venters's shoulder and wheeled him to\n",
       "meet a smoldering fire of gray eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, I couldn't tell Jane! I couldn't,” burst out Venters, reading\n",
       "his friend's mind. “I tried. But I couldn't. She wouldn't understand,\n",
       "and she has troubles enough. And I love the girl!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Venters, I reckon this beats me. I've seen some queer things in my\n",
       "time, too. This girl--who is she?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I don't know.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Don't know! What is she, then?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I don't know that, either. Oh, it's the strangest story you ever heard.\n",
       "I must tell you. But you'll never believe.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Venters, women were always puzzles to me. But for all that, if this\n",
       "girl ain't a child, an' as innocent, I'm no fit person to think of\n",
       "virtue an' goodness in anybody. Are you goin' to be square with her?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I am--so help me God!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckoned so. Mebbe my temper oughtn't led me to make sure. But, man,\n",
       "she's a woman in all but years. She's sweeter 'n the sage.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, I know, I know. And the hell of it is that in spite of her\n",
       "innocence and charm she's--she's not what she seems!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I wouldn't want to--of course, I couldn't call you a liar, Venters,”\n",
       " said the older man.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What's more, she was Oldring's Masked Rider!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters expected to floor his friend with that statement, but he was not\n",
       "in any way prepared for the shock his words gave. For an instant he was\n",
       "astounded to see Lassiter stunned; then his own passionate eagerness\n",
       "to unbosom himself, to tell the wonderful story, precluded any other\n",
       "thought.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Son, tell me all about this,” presently said Lassiter as he seated\n",
       "himself on a stone and wiped his moist brow.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thereupon Venters began his narrative at the point where he had shot the\n",
       "rustler and Oldring's Masked Rider, and he rushed through it, telling\n",
       "all, not holding back even Bess's unreserved avowal of her love or his\n",
       "deepest emotions.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That's the story,” he said, concluding. “I love her, though I've never\n",
       "told her. If I did tell her I'd be ready to marry her, and that seems\n",
       "impossible in this country. I'd be afraid to risk taking her anywhere.\n",
       "So I intend to do the best I can for her here.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“The longer I live the stranger life is,” mused Lassiter, with downcast\n",
       "eyes. “I'm reminded of somethin' you once said to Jane about hands in\n",
       "her game of life. There's that unseen hand of power, an' Tull's black\n",
       "hand, an' my red one, an' your indifferent one, an' the girl's little\n",
       "brown, helpless one. An', Venters there's another one that's all-wise\n",
       "an' all-wonderful. That's the hand guidin' Jane Withersteen's game of\n",
       "life!... Your story's one to daze a far clearer head than mine. I can't\n",
       "offer no advice, even if you asked for it. Mebbe I can help you. Anyway,\n",
       "I'll hold Oldrin' up when he comes to the village an' find out about\n",
       "this girl. I knew the rustler years ago. He'll remember me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, if I ever meet Oldring I'll kill him!” cried Venters, with\n",
       "sudden intensity.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon that'd be perfectly natural,” replied the rider.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Make him think Bess is dead--as she is to him and that old life.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sure, sure, son. Cool down now. If you're goin' to begin pullin' guns\n",
       "on Tull an' Oldin' you want to be cool. I reckon, though, you'd better\n",
       "keep hid here. Well, I must be leavin'.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“One thing, Lassiter. You'll not tell Jane about Bess? Please don't!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon not. But I wouldn't be afraid to bet that after she'd got\n",
       "over anger at your secrecy--Venters, she'd be furious once in her\n",
       "life!--she'd think more of you. I don't mind sayin' for myself that I\n",
       "think you're a good deal of a man.”\n",
       "\n",
       "In the further ascent Venters halted several times with the intention of\n",
       "saying good-by, yet he changed his mind and kept on climbing till they\n",
       "reached Balancing Rock. Lassiter examined the huge rock, listened to\n",
       "Venters's idea of its position and suggestion, and curiously placed a\n",
       "strong hand upon it.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hold on!” cried Venters. “I heaved at it once and have never gotten\n",
       "over my scare.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, you do seem uncommon nervous,” replied Lassiter, much amused.\n",
       "“Now, as for me, why I always had the funniest notion to roll stones!\n",
       "When I was a kid I did it, an' the bigger I got the bigger stones I'd\n",
       "roll. Ain't that funny? Honest--even now I often get off my hoss just to\n",
       "tumble a big stone over a precipice, en' watch it drop, en' listen to it\n",
       "bang an' boom. I've started some slides in my time, an' don't you forget\n",
       "it. I never seen a rock I wanted to roll as bad as this one! Wouldn't\n",
       "there jest be roarin', crashin' hell down that trail?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“You'd close the outlet forever!” exclaimed Venters. “Well, good-by,\n",
       "Lassiter. Keep my secret and don't forget me. And be mighty careful how\n",
       "you get out of the valley below. The rustlers' canyon isn't more than\n",
       "three miles up the Pass. Now you've tracked me here, I'll never feel\n",
       "safe again.”\n",
       "\n",
       "In his descent to the valley, Venters's emotion, roused to stirring\n",
       "pitch by the recital of his love story, quieted gradually, and in its\n",
       "place came a sober, thoughtful mood. All at once he saw that he was\n",
       "serious, because he would never more regain his sense of security while\n",
       "in the valley. What Lassiter could do another skilful tracker might\n",
       "duplicate. Among the many riders with whom Venters had ridden he\n",
       "recalled no one who could have taken his trail at Cottonwoods and have\n",
       "followed it to the edge of the bare slope in the pass, let alone up that\n",
       "glistening smooth stone. Lassiter, however, was not an ordinary rider.\n",
       "Instead of hunting cattle tracks he had likely spent a goodly portion\n",
       "of his life tracking men. It was not improbable that among Oldring's\n",
       "rustlers there was one who shared Lassiter's gift for trailing. And the\n",
       "more Venters dwelt on this possibility the more perturbed he grew.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter's visit, moreover, had a disquieting effect upon Bess, and\n",
       "Venters fancied that she entertained the same thought as to future\n",
       "seclusion. The breaking of their solitude, though by a well-meaning\n",
       "friend, had not only dispelled all its dream and much of its charm, but\n",
       "had instilled a canker of fear. Both had seen the footprint in the sand.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters did no more work that day. Sunset and twilight gave way to\n",
       "night, and the canyon bird whistled its melancholy notes, and the wind\n",
       "sang softly in the cliffs, and the camp-fire blazed and burned down to\n",
       "red embers. To Venters a subtle difference was apparent in all of these,\n",
       "or else the shadowy change had been in him. He hoped that on the morrow\n",
       "this slight depression would have passed away.\n",
       "\n",
       "In that measure, however, he was doomed to disappointment. Furthermore,\n",
       "Bess reverted to a wistful sadness that he had not observed in her since\n",
       "her recovery. His attempt to cheer her out of it resulted in dismal\n",
       "failure, and consequently in a darkening of his own mood. Hard work\n",
       "relieved him; still, when the day had passed, his unrest returned.\n",
       "Then he set to deliberate thinking, and there came to him the startling\n",

       "The plan eventually decided upon by the lovers was for Venters to go to\n",
       "the village, secure a horse and some kind of a disguise for Bess, or\n",
       "at least less striking apparel than her present garb, and to return\n",
       "post-haste to the valley. Meanwhile, she would add to their store of\n",
       "gold. Then they would strike the long and perilous trail to ride out of\n",
       "Utah. In the event of his inability to fetch back a horse for her, they\n",
       "intended to make the giant sorrel carry double. The gold, a little food,\n",
       "saddle blankets, and Venters's guns were to compose the light outfit\n",
       "with which they would make the start.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I love this beautiful place,” said Bess. “It's hard to think of leaving\n",
       "it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hard! Well, I should think so,” replied Venters. “Maybe--in years--”\n",
       " But he did not complete in words his thought that might be possible to\n",
       "return after many years of absence and change.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once again Bess bade Venters farewell under the shadow of Balancing\n",
       "Rock, and this time it was with whispered hope and tenderness and\n",
       "passionate trust. Long after he had left her, all down through the\n",
       "outlet to the Pass, the clinging clasp of her arms, the sweetness of\n",
       "her lips, and the sense of a new and exquisite birth of character in her\n",
       "remained hauntingly and thrillingly in his mind. The girl who had sadly\n",
       "called herself nameless and nothing had been marvelously transformed\n",
       "in the moment of his avowal of love. It was something to think over,\n",
       "something to warm his heart, but for the present it had absolutely to be\n",
       "forgotten so that all his mind could be addressed to the trip so fraught\n",
       "with danger.\n",
       "\n",
       "He carried only his rifle, revolver, and a small quantity of bread and\n",
       "meat, and thus lightly burdened, he made swift progress down the slope\n",
       "and out into the valley. Darkness was coming on, and he welcomed it.\n",
       "Stars were blinking when he reached his old hiding-place in the split of\n",
       "canyon wall, and by their aid he slipped through the dense thickets to\n",
       "the grassy enclosure. Wrangle stood in the center of it with his head\n",
       "up, and he appeared black and of gigantic proportions in the dim light.\n",
       "Venters whistled softly, began a slow approach, and then called. The\n",
       "horse snorted and, plunging away with dull, heavy sound of hoofs, he\n",
       "disappeared in the gloom. “Wilder than ever!” muttered Venters. He\n",
       "followed the sorrel into the narrowing split between the walls, and\n",
       "presently had to desist because he could not see a foot in advance. As\n",
       "he went back toward the open Wrangle jumped out of an ebony shadow of\n",
       "cliff and like a thunderbolt shot huge and black past him down into\n",
       "the starlit glade. Deciding that all attempts to catch Wrangle at night\n",
       "would be useless, Venters repaired to the shelving rock where he had\n",
       "hidden saddle and blanket, and there went to sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "The first peep of day found him stirring, and as soon as it was light\n",
       "enough to distinguish objects, he took his lasso off his saddle and went\n",
       "out to rope the sorrel. He espied Wrangle at the lower end of the cove\n",
       "and approached him in a perfectly natural manner. When he got near\n",
       "enough, Wrangle evidently recognized him, but was too wild to stand.\n",
       "He ran up the glade and on into the narrow lane between the walls. This\n",
       "favored Venters's speedy capture of the horse, so, coiling his noose\n",
       "ready to throw, he hurried on. Wrangle let Venters get to within a\n",
       "hundred feet and then he broke. But as he plunged by, rapidly getting\n",
       "into his stride, Venters made a perfect throw with the rope. He had\n",
       "time to brace himself for the shock; nevertheless, Wrangle threw him and\n",
       "dragged him several yards before halting.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You wild devil,” said Venters, as he slowly pulled Wrangle up. “Don't\n",
       "you know me? Come now--old fellow--so--so--”\n",
       "\n",
       "Wrangle yielded to the lasso and then to Venters's strong hand. He was\n",
       "as straggly and wild-looking as a horse left to roam free in the sage.\n",
       "He dropped his long ears and stood readily to be saddled and bridled.\n",
       "But he was exceedingly sensitive, and quivered at every touch and sound.\n",
       "Venters led him to the thicket, and, bending the close saplings to let\n",
       "him squeeze through, at length reached the open. Sharp survey in each\n",
       "direction assured him of the usual lonely nature of the canyon, then he\n",
       "was in the saddle, riding south.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wrangle's long, swinging canter was a wonderful ground-gainer. His\n",
       "stride was almost twice that of an ordinary horse; and his endurance was\n",
       "equally remarkable. Venters pulled him in occasionally, and walked him\n",
       "up the stretches of rising ground and along the soft washes. Wrangle\n",
       "had never yet shown any indication of distress while Venters rode him.\n",
       "Nevertheless, there was now reason to save the horse, therefore Venters\n",
       "did not resort to the hurry that had characterized his former trip.\n",
       "He camped at the last water in the Pass. What distance that was to\n",
       "Cottonwoods he did not know; he calculated, however, that it was in the\n",
       "neighborhood of fifty miles.\n",
       "\n",
       "Early in the morning he proceeded on his way, and about the middle of\n",
       "the forenoon reached the constricted gap that marked the southerly end\n",
       "of the Pass, and through which led the trail up to the sage-level. He\n",
       "spied out Lassiter's tracks in the dust, but no others, and dismounting,\n",
       "he straightened out Wrangle's bridle and began to lead him up the trail.\n",
       "The short climb, more severe on beast than on man, necessitated a rest\n",
       "on the level above, and during this he scanned the wide purple reaches\n",
       "of slope.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wrangle whistled his pleasure at the smell of the sage. Remounting,\n",
       "Venters headed up the white trail with the fragrant wind in his face. He\n",
       "had proceeded for perhaps a couple of miles when Wrangle stopped with a\n",
       "suddenness that threw Venters heavily against the pommel.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What's wrong, old boy?” called Venters, looking down for a loose shoe\n",
       "or a snake or a foot lamed by a picked-up stone. Unrewarded, he raised\n",
       "himself from his scrutiny. Wrangle stood stiff head high, with his\n",
       "long ears erect. Thus guided, Venters swiftly gazed ahead to make out a\n",
       "dust-clouded, dark group of horsemen riding down the slope. If they had\n",
       "seen him, it apparently made no difference in their speed or direction.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Wonder who they are!” exclaimed Venters. He was not disposed to run.\n",
       "His cool mood tightened under grip of excitement as he reflected that,\n",
       "whoever the approaching riders were, they could not be friends. He\n",
       "slipped out of the saddle and led Wrangle behind the tallest sage-brush.\n",
       "It might serve to conceal them until the riders were close enough for\n",
       "him to see who they were; after that he would be indifferent to how soon\n",
       "they discovered him.\n",
       "\n",
       "After looking to his rifle and ascertaining that it was in working\n",
       "order, he watched, and as he watched, slowly the force of a bitter\n",
       "fierceness, long dormant, gathered ready to flame into life. If those\n",
       "riders were not rustlers he had forgotten how rustlers looked and rode.\n",
       "On they came, a small group, so compact and dark that he could not tell\n",
       "their number. How unusual that their horses did not see Wrangle! But\n",
       "such failure, Venters decided, was owing to the speed with which they\n",
       "were traveling. They moved at a swift canter affected more by rustlers\n",
       "than by riders. Venters grew concerned over the possibility that these\n",
       "horsemen would actually ride down on him before he had a chance to\n",
       "tell what to expect. When they were within three hundred yards he\n",
       "deliberately led Wrangle out into the trail.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then he heard shouts, and the hard scrape of sliding hoofs, and saw\n",
       "horses rear and plunge back with up-flung heads and flying manes.\n",
       "Several little white puffs of smoke appeared sharply against the black\n",
       "background of riders and horses, and shots rang out. Bullets struck far\n",
       "in front of Venters, and whipped up the dust and then hummed low into\n",
       "the sage. The range was great for revolvers, but whether the shots were\n",
       "meant to kill or merely to check advance, they were enough to fire that\n",
       "waiting ferocity in Venters. Slipping his arm through the bridle, so\n",
       "that Wrangle could not get away, Venters lifted his rifle and pulled the\n",
       "trigger twice.\n",
       "\n",
       "He saw the first horseman lean sideways and fall. He saw another lurch\n",
       "in his saddle and heard a cry of pain. Then Wrangle, plunging in fright,\n",
       "lifted Venters and nearly threw him. He jerked the horse down with\n",
       "a powerful hand and leaped into the saddle. Wrangle plunged again,\n",
       "dragging his bridle, that Venters had not had time to throw in place.\n",
       "Bending over with a swift movement, he secured it and dropped the loop\n",
       "over the pommel. Then, with grinding teeth, he looked to see what the\n",
       "issue would be.\n",
       "\n",
       "The band had scattered so as not to afford such a broad mark for\n",
       "bullets. The riders faced Venters, some with red-belching guns. He heard\n",
       "a sharper report, and just as Wrangle plunged again he caught the whim\n",
       "of a leaden missile that would have hit him but for Wrangle's sudden\n",
       "jump. A swift, hot wave, turning cold, passed over Venters. Deliberately\n",
       "he picked out the one rider with a carbine, and killed him. Wrangle\n",
       "snorted shrilly and bolted into the sage. Venters let him run a few\n",
       "rods, then with iron arm checked him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Five riders, surely rustlers, were left. One leaped out of the saddle to\n",
       "secure his fallen comrade's carbine. A shot from Venters, which missed\n",
       "the man but sent the dust flying over him made him run back to his\n",
       "horse. Then they separated. The crippled rider went one way; the one\n",
       "frustrated in his attempt to get the carbine rode another, Venters\n",
       "thought he made out a third rider, carrying a strange-appearing bundle\n",
       "and disappearing in the sage. But in the rapidity of action and vision\n",
       "he could not discern what it was. Two riders with three horses swung\n",
       "out to the right. Afraid of the long rifle--a burdensome weapon seldom\n",
       "carried by rustlers or riders--they had been put to rout.\n",
       "\n",
       "Suddenly Venters discovered that one of the two men last noted was\n",
       "riding Jane Withersteen's horse Bells--the beautiful bay racer she had\n",
       "given to Lassiter. Venters uttered a savage outcry. Then the small,\n",
       "wiry, frog-like shape of the second rider, and the ease and grace of his\n",
       "seat in the saddle--things so strikingly incongruous--grew more and more\n",
       "familiar in Venters's sight.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jerry Card!” cried Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was indeed Tull's right-hand man. Such a white hot wrath inflamed\n",
       "Venters that he fought himself to see with clearer gaze.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's Jerry Card!” he exclaimed, instantly. “And he's riding Black Star\n",
       "and leading Night!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The long-kindling, stormy fire in Venters's heart burst into flame. He\n",
       "spurred Wrangle, and as the horse lengthened his stride Venters slipped\n",
       "cartridges into the magazine of his rifle till it was once again full.\n",
       "Card and his companion were now half a mile or more in advance, riding\n",
       "easily down the slope. Venters marked the smooth gait, and understood it\n",
       "when Wrangle galloped out of the sage into the broad cattle trail,\n",
       "down which Venters had once tracked Jane Withersteen's red herd. This\n",
       "hard-packed trail, from years of use, was as clean and smooth as a road.\n",
       "Venters saw Jerry Card look back over his shoulder, the other rider did\n",
       "likewise. Then the three racers lengthened their stride to the point\n",
       "where the swinging canter was ready to break into a gallop.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Wrangle, the race's on,” said Venters, grimly. “We'll canter with them\n",
       "and gallop with them and run with them. We'll let them set the pace.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters knew he bestrode the strongest, swiftest, most tireless horse\n",
       "ever ridden by any rider across the Utah uplands. Recalling Jane\n",
       "Withersteen's devoted assurance that Night could run neck and neck with\n",
       "Wrangle, and Black Star could show his heels to him, Venters wished\n",
       "that Jane were there to see the race to recover her blacks and in the\n",
       "unqualified superiority of the giant sorrel. Then Venters found himself\n",
       "thankful that she was absent, for he meant that race to end in Jerry\n",
       "Card's death. The first flush, the raging of Venters's wrath, passed, to\n",
       "leave him in sullen, almost cold possession of his will. It was a deadly\n",
       "mood, utterly foreign to his nature, engendered, fostered, and released\n",
       "by the wild passions of wild men in a wild country. The strength in\n",
       "him then--the thing rife in him that was not hate, but something as\n",
       "remorseless--might have been the fiery fruition of a whole lifetime of\n",
       "vengeful quest. Nothing could have stopped him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters thought out the race shrewdly. The rider on Bells would probably\n",
       "drop behind and take to the sage. What he did was of little moment\n",
       "to Venters. To stop Jerry Card, his evil hidden career as well as\n",
       "his present flight, and then to catch the blacks--that was all that\n",
       "concerned Venters. The cattle trail wound for miles and miles down the\n",
       "slope. Venters saw with a rider's keen vision ten, fifteen, twenty miles\n",
       "of clear purple sage. There were no on-coming riders or rustlers to aid\n",
       "Card. His only chance to escape lay in abandoning the stolen horses and\n",
       "creeping away in the sage to hide. In ten miles Wrangle could run\n",
       "Black Star and Night off their feet, and in fifteen he could kill them\n",
       "outright. So Venters held the sorrel in, letting Card make the running.\n",
       "It was a long race that would save the blacks.\n",
       "\n",
       "In a few miles of that swinging canter Wrangle had crept appreciably\n",
       "closer to the three horses. Jerry Card turned again, and when he saw how\n",
       "the sorrel had gained, he put Black Star to a gallop. Night and Bells,\n",
       "on either side of him, swept into his stride.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters loosened the rein on Wrangle and let him break into a gallop.\n",
       "The sorrel saw the horses ahead and wanted to run. But Venters\n",
       "restrained him. And in the gallop he gained more than in the canter.\n",
       "Bells was fast in that gait, but Black Star and Night had been trained\n",
       "to run. Slowly Wrangle closed the gap down to a quarter of a mile, and\n",
       "crept closer and closer.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jerry Card wheeled once more. Venters distinctly saw the red flash of\n",
       "his red face. This time he looked long. Venters laughed. He knew what\n",
       "passed in Card's mind. The rider was trying to make out what horse it\n",
       "happened to be that thus gained on Jane Withersteen's peerless racers.\n",
       "Wrangle had so long been away from the village that not improbably Jerry\n",
       "had forgotten. Besides, whatever Jerry's qualifications for his fame as\n",
       "the greatest rider of the sage, certain it was that his best point was\n",
       "not far-sightedness. He had not recognized Wrangle. After what must have\n",
       "been a searching gaze he got his comrade to face about. This action gave\n",
       "Venters amusement. It spoke so surely of the facts that neither Card\n",
       "nor the rustler actually knew their danger. Yet if they kept to the\n",
       "trail--and the last thing such men would do would be to leave it--they\n",
       "were both doomed.\n",
       "\n",
       "This comrade of Card's whirled far around in his saddle, and he even\n",
       "shaded his eyes from the sun. He, too, looked long. Then, all at once,\n",
       "he faced ahead again and, bending lower in the saddle, began to fling\n",
       "his right arm up and down. That flinging Venters knew to be the lashing\n",
       "of Bells. Jerry also became active. And the three racers lengthened out\n",
       "into a run.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Now, Wrangle!” cried Venters. “Run, you big devil! Run!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters laid the reins on Wrangle's neck and dropped the loop over\n",
       "the pommel. The sorrel needed no guiding on that smooth trail. He was\n",
       "surer-footed in a run than at any other fast gait, and his running gave\n",
       "the impression of something devilish. He might now have been actuated by\n",
       "Venters's spirit; undoubtedly his savage running fitted the mood of his\n",
       "rider. Venters bent forward swinging with the horse, and gripped his\n",
       "rifle. His eye measured the distance between him and Jerry Card.\n",
       "\n",
       "In less than two miles of running Bells began to drop behind the blacks,\n",
       "and Wrangle began to overhaul him. Venters anticipated that the rustler\n",
       "would soon take to the sage. Yet he did not. Not improbably he reasoned\n",
       "that the powerful sorrel could more easily overtake Bells in the heavier\n",
       "going outside of the trail. Soon only a few hundred yards lay between\n",
       "Bells and Wrangle. Turning in his saddle, the rustler began to shoot,\n",
       "and the bullets beat up little whiffs of dust. Venters raised his rifle,\n",
       "ready to take snap shots, and waited for favorable opportunity when\n",
       "Bells was out of line with the forward horses. Venters had it in him\n",
       "to kill these men as if they were skunk-bitten coyotes, but also he had\n",
       "restraint enough to keep from shooting one of Jane's beloved Arabians.\n",
       "\n",
       "No great distance was covered, however, before Bells swerved to the\n",
       "left, out of line with Black Star and Night. Then Venters, aiming high\n",
       "and waiting for the pause between Wrangle's great strides, began to take\n",
       "snap shots at the rustler. The fleeing rider presented a broad target\n",
       "for a rifle, but he was moving swiftly forward and bobbing up and down.\n",
       "Moreover, shooting from Wrangle's back was shooting from a thunderbolt.\n",
       "And added to that was the danger of a low-placed bullet taking effect\n",
       "on Bells. Yet, despite these considerations, making the shot exceedingly\n",
       "difficult, Venters's confidence, like his implacability, saw a speedy\n",
       "and fatal termination of that rustler's race. On the sixth shot the\n",
       "rustler threw up his arms and took a flying tumble off his horse. He\n",
       "rolled over and over, hunched himself to a half-erect position, fell,\n",
       "and then dragged himself into the sage. As Venters went thundering by he\n",
       "peered keenly into the sage, but caught no sign of the man. Bells ran a\n",
       "few hundred yards, slowed up, and had stopped when Wrangle passed him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Again Venters began slipping fresh cartridges into the magazine of his\n",
       "rifle, and his hand was so sure and steady that he did not drop a single\n",
       "cartridge. With the eye of a rider and the judgment of a marksman he\n",
       "once more measured the distance between him and Jerry Card. Wrangle had\n",
       "gained, bringing him into rifle range. Venters was hard put to it now\n",
       "not to shoot, but thought it better to withhold his fire. Jerry, who, in\n",
       "anticipation of a running fusillade, had huddled himself into a little\n",
       "twisted ball on Black Star's neck, now surmising that this pursuer would\n",
       "make sure of not wounding one of the blacks, rose to his natural seat in\n",
       "the saddle.\n",
       "\n",
       "In his mind perhaps, as certainly as in Venters's, this moment was the\n",
       "beginning of the real race.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters leaned forward to put his hand on Wrangle's neck, then backward\n",
       "to put it on his flank. Under the shaggy, dusty hair trembled and\n",
       "vibrated and rippled a wonderful muscular activity. But Wrangle's flesh\n",
       "was still cold. What a cold-blooded brute thought Venters, and felt in\n",
       "him a love for the horse he had never given to any other. It would not\n",
       "have been humanly possible for any rider, even though clutched by hate\n",
       "or revenge or a passion to save a loved one or fear of his own life, to\n",
       "be astride the sorrel to swing with his swing, to see his magnificent\n",
       "stride and hear the rapid thunder of his hoofs, to ride him in that race\n",
       "and not glory in the ride.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, with his passion to kill still keen and unabated, Venters lived out\n",
       "that ride, and drank a rider's sage-sweet cup of wildness to the dregs.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Wrangle's long mane, lashing in the wind, stung Venters in the\n",
       "cheek, the sting added a beat to his flying pulse. He bent a downward\n",
       "glance to try to see Wrangle's actual stride, and saw only twinkling,\n",
       "darting streaks and the white rush of the trail. He watched the sorrel's\n",
       "savage head, pointed level, his mouth still closed and dry, but his\n",
       "nostrils distended as if he were snorting unseen fire. Wrangle was the\n",
       "horse for a race with death. Upon each side Venters saw the sage merged\n",
       "into a sailing, colorless wall. In front sloped the lay of ground with\n",
       "its purple breadth split by the white trail. The wind, blowing with\n",
       "heavy, steady blast into his face, sickened him with enduring, sweet\n",
       "odor, and filled his ears with a hollow, rushing roar.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then for the hundredth time he measured the width of space separating\n",
       "him from Jerry Card. Wrangle had ceased to gain. The blacks were proving\n",
       "their fleetness. Venters watched Jerry Card, admiring the little rider's\n",
       "horsemanship. He had the incomparable seat of the upland rider, born in\n",
       "the saddle. It struck Venters that Card had changed his position, or\n",
       "the position of the horses. Presently Venters remembered positively that\n",
       "Jerry had been leading Night on the right-hand side of the trail. The\n",
       "racer was now on the side to the left. No--it was Black Star. But,\n",
       "Venters argued in amaze, Jerry had been mounted on Black Star. Another\n",
       "clearer, keener gaze assured Venters that Black Star was really\n",
       "riderless. Night now carried Jerry Card.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He's changed from one to the other!” ejaculated Venters, realizing the\n",
       "astounding feat with unstinted admiration. “Changed at full speed! Jerry\n",
       "Card, that's what you've done unless I'm drunk on the smell of sage. But\n",
       "I've got to see the trick before I believe it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Thenceforth, while Wrangle sped on, Venters glued his eyes to the little\n",
       "rider. Jerry Card rode as only he could ride. Of all the daring\n",
       "horsemen of the uplands, Jerry was the one rider fitted to bring out the\n",
       "greatness of the blacks in that long race. He had them on a dead run,\n",
       "but not yet at the last strained and killing pace. From time to time he\n",
       "glanced backward, as a wise general in retreat calculating his chances\n",
       "and the power and speed of pursuers, and the moment for the last\n",
       "desperate burst. No doubt, Card, with his life at stake, gloried in that\n",
       "race, perhaps more wildly than Venters. For he had been born to the sage\n",
       "and the saddle and the wild. He was more than half horse. Not until the\n",
       "last call--the sudden up-flashing instinct of self-preservation--would\n",
       "he lose his skill and judgment and nerve and the spirit of that race.\n",
       "Venters seemed to read Jerry's mind. That little crime-stained rider was\n",
       "actually thinking of his horses, husbanding their speed, handling them\n",
       "with knowledge of years, glorying in their beautiful, swift, racing\n",
       "stride, and wanting them to win the race when his own life hung\n",
       "suspended in quivering balance. Again Jerry whirled in his saddle and\n",
       "the sun flashed red on his face. Turning, he drew Black Star closer and\n",
       "closer toward Night, till they ran side by side, as one horse. Then Card\n",
       "raised himself in the saddle, slipped out of the stirrups, and, somehow\n",
       "twisting himself, leaped upon Black Star. He did not even lose the swing\n",
       "of the horse. Like a leech he was there in the other saddle, and as the\n",
       "horses separated, his right foot, that had been apparently doubled under\n",
       "him, shot down to catch the stirrup. The grace and dexterity and daring\n",
       "of that rider's act won something more than admiration from Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the distance of a mile Jerry rode Black Star and then changed back\n",
       "to Night. But all Jerry's skill and the running of the blacks could\n",
       "avail little more against the sorrel.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters peered far ahead, studying the lay of the land. Straightaway\n",
       "for five miles the trail stretched, and then it disappeared in hummocky\n",
       "ground. To the right, some few rods, Venters saw a break in the sage,\n",
       "and this was the rim of Deception Pass. Across the dark cleft gleamed\n",
       "the red of the opposite wall. Venters imagined that the trail went down\n",
       "into the Pass somewhere north of those ridges. And he realized that\n",
       "he must and would overtake Jerry Card in this straight course of five\n",
       "miles.\n",
       "\n",
       "Cruelly he struck his spurs into Wrangle's flanks. A light touch of spur\n",
       "was sufficient to make Wrangle plunge. And now, with a ringing, wild\n",
       "snort, he seemed to double up in muscular convulsions and to shoot\n",
       "forward with an impetus that almost unseated Venters. The sage blurred\n",
       "by, the trail flashed by, and the wind robbed him of breath and hearing.\n",
       "Jerry Card turned once more. And the way he shifted to Black Star showed\n",
       "he had to make his last desperate running. Venters aimed to the side of\n",
       "the trail and sent a bullet puffing the dust beyond Jerry. Venters\n",
       "hoped to frighten the rider and get him to take to the sage. But Jerry\n",
       "returned the shot, and his ball struck dangerously close in the dust\n",
       "at Wrangle's flying feet. Venters held his fire then, while the rider\n",
       "emptied his revolver. For a mile, with Black Star leaving Night behind\n",
       "and doing his utmost, Wrangle did not gain; for another mile he gained\n",
       "little, if at all. In the third he caught up with the now galloping\n",
       "Night and began to gain rapidly on the other black.\n",
       "\n",
       "Only a hundred yards now stretched between Black Star and Wrangle. The\n",
       "giant sorrel thundered on--and on--and on. In every yard he gained\n",
       "a foot. He was whistling through his nostrils, wringing wet, flying\n",
       "lather, and as hot as fire. Savage as ever, strong as ever, fast as\n",
       "ever, but each tremendous stride jarred Venters out of the saddle!\n",
       "Wrangle's power and spirit and momentum had begun to run him off his\n",
       "legs. Wrangle's great race was nearly won--and run. Venters seemed to\n",
       "see the expanse before him as a vast, sheeted, purple plain sliding\n",
       "under him. Black Star moved in it as a blur. The rider, Jerry Card,\n",
       "appeared a mere dot bobbing dimly. Wrangle thundered on--on--on! Venters\n",
       "felt the increase in quivering, straining shock after every leap. Flecks\n",
       "of foam flew into Venters's eyes, burning him, making him see all the\n",
       "sage as red. But in that red haze he saw, or seemed to see, Black Star\n",
       "suddenly riderless and with broken gait. Wrangle thundered on to change\n",
       "his pace with a violent break. Then Venters pulled him hard. From run\n",
       "to gallop, gallop to canter, canter to trot, trot to walk, and walk to\n",
       "stop, the great sorrel ended his race.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters looked back. Black Star stood riderless in the trail. Jerry\n",
       "Card had taken to the sage. Far up the white trail Night came trotting\n",
       "faithfully down. Venters leaped off, still half blind, reeling dizzily.\n",
       "In a moment he had recovered sufficiently to have a care for Wrangle.\n",
       "Rapidly he took off the saddle and bridle. The sorrel was reeking,\n",
       "heaving, whistling, shaking. But he had still the strength to stand, and\n",
       "for him Venters had no fears.\n",
       "\n",
       "As Venters ran back to Black Star he saw the horse stagger on shaking\n",
       "legs into the sage and go down in a heap. Upon reaching him Venters\n",
       "removed the saddle and bridle. Black Star had been killed on his legs,\n",
       "Venters thought. He had no hope for the stricken horse. Black Star\n",
       "lay flat, covered with bloody froth, mouth wide, tongue hanging, eyes\n",
       "glaring, and all his beautiful body in convulsions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Unable to stay there to see Jane's favorite racer die, Venters hurried\n",
       "up the trail to meet the other black. On the way he kept a sharp lookout\n",
       "for Jerry Card. Venters imagined the rider would keep well out of range\n",
       "of the rifle, but, as he would be lost on the sage without a horse, not\n",
       "improbably he would linger in the vicinity on the chance of getting back\n",
       "one of the blacks. Night soon came trotting up, hot and wet and run out.\n",
       "Venters led him down near the others, and unsaddling him, let him loose\n",
       "to rest. Night wearily lay down in the dust and rolled, proving himself\n",
       "not yet spent.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Venters sat down to rest and think. Whatever the risk, he was\n",
       "compelled to stay where he was, or comparatively near, for the night.\n",
       "The horses must rest and drink. He must find water. He was now seventy\n",
       "miles from Cottonwoods, and, he believed, close to the canyon where the\n",
       "cattle trail must surely turn off and go down into the Pass. After a\n",
       "while he rose to survey the valley.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was very near to the ragged edge of a deep canyon into which the\n",
       "trail turned. The ground lay in uneven ridges divided by washes, and\n",
       "these sloped into the canyon. Following the canyon line, he saw where\n",
       "its rim was broken by other intersecting canyons, and farther down red\n",
       "walls and yellow cliffs leading toward a deep blue cleft that he made\n",
       "sure was Deception Pass. Walking out a few rods to a promontory, he\n",
       "found where the trail went down. The descent was gradual, along a\n",
       "stone-walled trail, and Venters felt sure that this was the place where\n",
       "Oldring drove cattle into the Pass. There was, however, no indication at\n",
       "all that he ever had driven cattle out at this point. Oldring had many\n",
       "holes to his burrow.\n",
       "\n",
       "In searching round in the little hollows Venters, much to his relief,\n",
       "found water. He composed himself to rest and eat some bread and meat,\n",
       "while he waited for a sufficient time to elapse so that he could safely\n",
       "give the horses a drink. He judged the hour to be somewhere around noon.\n",
       "Wrangle lay down to rest and Night followed suit. So long as they\n",
       "were down Venters intended to make no move. The longer they rested\n",
       "the better, and the safer it would be to give them water. By and by he\n",
       "forced himself to go over to where Black Star lay, expecting to find\n",
       "him dead. Instead he found the racer partially if not wholly recovered.\n",
       "There was recognition, even fire, in his big black eyes. Venters was\n",
       "overjoyed. He sat by the black for a long time. Black Star presently\n",
       "labored to his feet with a heave and a groan, shook himself, and snorted\n",
       "for water. Venters repaired to the little pool he had found, filled\n",
       "his sombrero, and gave the racer a drink. Black Star gulped it at one\n",
       "draught, as if it were but a drop, and pushed his nose into the hat\n",
       "and snorted for more. Venters now led Night down to drink, and after a\n",
       "further time Black Star also. Then the blacks began to graze.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sorrel had wandered off down the sage between the trail and the\n",
       "canyon. Once or twice he disappeared in little swales. Finally Venters\n",
       "concluded Wrangle had grazed far enough, and, taking his lasso, he went\n",
       "to fetch him back. In crossing from one ridge to another he saw where\n",
       "the horse had made muddy a pool of water. It occurred to Venters then\n",
       "that Wrangle had drunk his fill, and did not seem the worse for it, and\n",
       "might be anything but easy to catch. And, true enough, he could not come\n",
       "within roping reach of the sorrel. He tried for an hour, and gave up in\n",
       "disgust. Wrangle did not seem so wild as simply perverse. In a quandary\n",
       "Venters returned to the other horses, hoping much, yet doubting more,\n",
       "that when Wrangle had grazed to suit himself he might be caught.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the afternoon wore away Venters's concern diminished, yet he kept\n",
       "close watch on the blacks and the trail and the sage. There was no\n",
       "telling of what Jerry Card might be capable. Venters sullenly acquiesced\n",
       "to the idea that the rider had been too quick and too shrewd for him.\n",
       "Strangely and doggedly, however, Venters clung to his foreboding of\n",
       "Card's downfall.\n",
       "\n",
       "The wind died away; the red sun topped the far distant western rise of\n",
       "slope; and the long, creeping purple shadows lengthened. The rims of the\n",
       "canyons gleamed crimson and the deep clefts appeared to belch forth blue\n",
       "smoke. Silence enfolded the scene.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was broken by a horrid, long-drawn scream of a horse and the thudding\n",
       "of heavy hoofs. Venters sprang erect and wheeled south. Along the canyon\n",
       "rim, near the edge, came Wrangle, once more in thundering flight.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters gasped in amazement. Had the wild sorrel gone mad? His head\n",
       "was high and twisted, in a most singular position for a running horse.\n",
       "Suddenly Venters descried a frog-like shape clinging to Wrangle's neck.\n",

       "burr. But it was his strange position and the sorrel's wild scream that\n",
       "shook Venters's nerves. Wrangle was pounding toward the turn where the\n",
       "trail went down. He plunged onward like a blind horse. More than one of\n",
       "his leaps took him to the very edge of the precipice.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jerry Card was bent forward with his teeth fast in the front of\n",
       "Wrangle's nose! Venters saw it, and there flashed over him a memory of\n",
       "this trick of a few desperate riders. He even thought of one rider\n",
       "who had worn off his teeth in this terrible hold to break or control\n",
       "desperate horses. Wrangle had indeed gone mad. The marvel was what\n",
       "guided him. Was it the half-brute, the more than half-horse instinct of\n",
       "Jerry Card? Whatever the mystery, it was true. And in a few more rods\n",
       "Jerry would have the sorrel turning into the trail leading down into the\n",
       "canyon.\n",
       "\n",
       "“No--Jerry!” whispered Venters, stepping forward and throwing up the\n",
       "rifle. He tried to catch the little humped, frog-like shape over the\n",
       "sights. It was moving too fast; it was too small. Yet Venters shot\n",
       "once... twice... the third time... four times... five! all wasted shots and\n",
       "precious seconds!\n",
       "\n",
       "With a deep-muttered curse Venters caught Wrangle through the sights and\n",
       "pulled the trigger. Plainly he heard the bullet thud. Wrangle uttered\n",
       "a horrible strangling sound. In swift death action he whirled, and\n",
       "with one last splendid leap he cleared the canyon rim. And he whirled\n",
       "downward with the little frog-like shape clinging to his neck!\n",
       "\n",
       "There was a pause which seemed never ending, a shock, and an instant's\n",
       "silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then up rolled a heavy crash, a long roar of sliding rocks dying away in\n",

       "\n",
       "Some forty hours or more later Venters created a commotion in\n",
       "Cottonwoods by riding down the main street on Black Star and leading\n",
       "Bells and Night. He had come upon Bells grazing near the body of a dead\n",
       "rustler, the only incident of his quick ride into the village.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nothing was farther from Venters's mind than bravado. No thought came\n",
       "to him of the defiance and boldness of riding Jane Withersteen's racers\n",
       "straight into the arch-plotter's stronghold. He wanted men to see the\n",
       "famous Arabians; he wanted men to see them dirty and dusty, bearing all\n",
       "the signs of having been driven to their limit; he wanted men to see and\n",
       "to know that the thieves who had ridden them out into the sage had not\n",
       "ridden them back. Venters had come for that and for more--he wanted to\n",
       "meet Tull face to face; if not Tull, then Dyer; if not Dyer, then anyone\n",
       "in the secret of these master conspirators. Such was Venters's passion.\n",
       "The meeting with the rustlers, the unprovoked attack upon him, the\n",
       "spilling of blood, the recognition of Jerry Card and the horses, the\n",
       "race, and that last plunge of mad Wrangle--all these things, fuel on\n",
       "fuel to the smoldering fire, had kindled and swelled and leaped into\n",
       "living flame. He could have shot Dyer in the midst of his religious\n",
       "services at the altar; he could have killed Tull in front of wives and\n",
       "babes.\n",
       "\n",
       "He walked the three racers down the broad, green-bordered village road.\n",
       "He heard the murmur of running water from Amber Spring. Bitter waters\n",
       "for Jane Withersteen! Men and women stopped to gaze at him and the\n",
       "horses. All knew him; all knew the blacks and the bay. As well as if it\n",
       "had been spoken, Venters read in the faces of men the intelligence that\n",
       "Jane Withersteen's Arabians had been known to have been stolen. Venters\n",
       "reined in and halted before Dyer's residence. It was a low, long, stone\n",
       "structure resembling Withersteen House. The spacious front yard was\n",
       "green and luxuriant with grass and flowers; gravel walks led to the huge\n",
       "porch; a well-trimmed hedge of purple sage separated the yard from the\n",
       "church grounds; birds sang in the trees; water flowed musically along\n",
       "the walks; and there were glad, careless shouts of children. For Venters\n",
       "the beauty of this home, and the serenity and its apparent happiness,\n",
       "all turned red and black. For Venters a shade overspread the lawn, the\n",
       "flowers, the old vine-clad stone house. In the music of the singing\n",
       "birds, in the murmur of the running water, he heard an ominous sound.\n",
       "Quiet beauty--sweet music--innocent laughter! By what monstrous abortion\n",
       "of fate did these abide in the shadow of Dyer?\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters rode on and stopped before Tull's cottage. Women stared at him\n",
       "with white faces and then flew from the porch. Tull himself appeared\n",
       "at the door, bent low, craning his neck. His dark face flashed out of\n",
       "sight; the door banged; a heavy bar dropped with a hollow sound.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Venters shook Black Star's bridle, and, sharply trotting, led the\n",
       "other horses to the center of the village. Here at the intersecting\n",
       "streets and in front of the stores he halted once more. The usual\n",
       "lounging atmosphere of that prominent corner was not now in evidence.\n",
       "Riders and ranchers and villagers broke up what must have been absorbing\n",
       "conversation. There was a rush of many feet, and then the walk was lined\n",
       "with faces.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters's glance swept down the line of silent stone-faced men. He\n",
       "recognized many riders and villagers, but none of those he had hoped\n",
       "to meet. There was no expression in the faces turned toward him. All\n",
       "of them knew him, most were inimical, but there were few who were\n",
       "not burning with curiosity and wonder in regard to the return of Jane\n",
       "Withersteen's racers. Yet all were silent. Here were the familiar\n",
       "characteristics--masked feeling--strange secretiveness--expressionless\n",
       "expression of mystery and hidden power.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Has anybody here seen Jerry Card?” queried Venters, in a loud voice.\n",
       "\n",
       "In reply there came not a word, not a nod or shake of head, not so much\n",
       "as dropping eye or twitching lip--nothing but a quiet, stony stare.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Been under the knife? You've a fine knife-wielder here--one Tull, I\n",
       "believe!... Maybe you've all had your tongues cut out?”\n",
       "\n",
       "This passionate sarcasm of Venters brought no response, and the stony\n",
       "calm was as oil on the fire within him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I see some of you pack guns, too!” he added, in biting scorn. In the\n",
       "long, tense pause, strung keenly as a tight wire, he sat motionless on\n",
       "Black Star. “All right,” he went on. “Then let some of you take this\n",

       "\n",
       "Thereupon, in the same dead calm, Venters backed Black Star away from\n",

       "\n",
       "“Hello, Venters!” a familiar voice cried, hoarsely, and he saw a man\n",
       "running toward him. It was the rider Judkins who came up and gripped\n",
       "Venters's hand. “Venters, I could hev dropped when I seen them hosses.\n",
       "But thet sight ain't a marker to the looks of you. What's wrong? Hev\n",

       "“Hasn't Lassiter made a break yet?” inquired Venters, curiously.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Naw!” replied Judkins, scornfully. “Jane turned his head. He's mad in\n",
       "love over her--follers her like a dog. He ain't no more Lassiter! He's\n",
       "lost his nerve, he doesn't look like the same feller. It's village talk.\n",
       "Everybody knows it. He hasn't thrown a gun, an' he won't!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jud, I'll bet he does,” replied Venters, earnestly. “Remember what I\n",
       "say. This Lassiter is something more than a gun-man. Jud, he's big--he's\n",
       "great!... I feel that in him. God help Tull and Dyer when Lassiter does\n",
       "go after them. For horses and riders and stone walls won't save them.”\n",

       "or whatever's great in him thet sort of paralyzes people. No later 'n\n",
       "this mornin' I seen him saunterin' down the lane, quiet an' slow. An'\n",

       "somethin's wrong. You're whiter 'n a sheet. You can't be scared of the\n",
       "rustler. I don't believe you've got a scare in you. Wal, now, jest let\n",
       "me talk. You know I like to talk, an' if I'm slow I allus git there\n",
       "sometime. As I said, Lassiter was talkie' chummy with Oldrin'. There\n",
       "wasn't no hard feelin's. An' the gang wasn't payin' no pertic'lar\n",
       "attention. But like a cat watchin' a mouse I hed my eyes on them two\n",
       "fellers. It was strange to me, thet confab. I'm gittin' to think a lot,\n",
       "fer a feller who doesn't know much. There's been some queer deals lately\n",

       "an' so close their big gun-hilts butted together. I seen Oldrin' was\n",
       "some surprised at first, an' Lassiter was cool as ice. They talked, an'\n",
       "presently at somethin' Lassiter said the rustler bawled out a curse, an'\n",
       "then he jest fell up against the bar, an' sagged there. The gang in the\n",
       "saloon looked around an' laughed, an' thet's about all. Finally Oldrin'\n",
       "turned, and it was easy to see somethin' hed shook him. Yes, sir, thet\n",
       "big rustler--you know he's as broad as he is long, an' the powerfulest\n",
       "build of a man--yes, sir, the nerve had been taken out of him. Then,\n",
       "after a little, he began to talk an' said a lot to Lassiter, an' by an'\n",
       "by it didn't take much of an eye to see thet Lassiter was gittin' hit\n",
       "hard. I never seen him anyway but cooler 'n ice--till then. He seemed to\n",
       "be hit harder 'n Oldrin', only he didn't roar out thet way. He jest kind\n",
       "of sunk in, an' looked an' looked, an' he didn't see a livin' soul\n",
       "in thet saloon. Then he sort of come to, an' shakin' hands--mind you,\n",
       "shakin' hands with Oldrin'--he went out. I couldn't help thinkin' how\n",
       "easy even a boy could hev dropped the great gun-man then!... Wal, the\n",
       "rustler stood at the bar fer a long time, en' he was seein' things far\n",
       "off, too; then he come to an' roared fer whisky, an' gulped a drink thet\n",
       "was big enough to drown me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Is Oldring here now?” whispered Venters. He could not speak above a\n",
       "whisper. Judkins's story had been meaningless to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He's at Snell's yet. Bern, I hevn't told you yet thet the rustlers hev\n",
       "been raisin' hell. They shot up Stone Bridge an' Glaze, an' fer three\n",
       "days they've been here drinkin' an' gamblin' an' throwin' of gold. These\n",
       "rustlers hev a pile of gold. If it was gold dust or nugget gold I'd hev\n",
       "reason to think, but it's new coin gold, as if it had jest come from the\n",
       "United States treasury. An' the coin's genuine. Thet's all been proved.\n",
       "The truth is Oldrin's on a rampage. A while back he lost his Masked\n",
       "Rider, an' they say he's wild about thet. I'm wonderin' if Lassiter\n",
       "could hev told the rustler anythin' about thet little masked,\n",
       "hard-ridin' devil. Ride! He was most as good as Jerry Card. An', Bern,\n",
       "I've been wonderin' if you know--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Judkins, you're a good fellow,” interrupted Venters. “Some day I'll\n",
       "tell you a story. I've no time now. Take the horses to Jane.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Judkins stared, and then, muttering to himself, he mounted Bells, and\n",
       "stared again at Venters, and then, leading the other horses, he rode\n",
       "into the grove and disappeared.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once, long before, on the night Venters had carried Bess through the\n",
       "canyon and up into Surprise Valley, he had experienced the strangeness\n",
       "of faculties singularly, tinglingly acute. And now the same sensation\n",
       "recurred. But it was different in that he felt cold, frozen, mechanical\n",
       "incapable of free thought, and all about him seemed unreal, aloof,\n",
       "remote. He hid his rifle in the sage, marking its exact location with\n",
       "extreme care. Then he faced down the lane and strode toward the center\n",
       "of the village. Perceptions flashed upon him, the faint, cold touch of\n",
       "the breeze, a cold, silvery tinkle of flowing water, a cold sun shining\n",
       "out of a cold sky, song of birds and laugh of children, coldly distant.\n",
       "Cold and intangible were all things in earth and heaven. Colder and\n",
       "tighter stretched the skin over his face; colder and harder grew the\n",
       "polished butts of his guns; colder and steadier became his hands as he\n",
       "wiped the clammy sweat from his face or reached low to his gun-sheaths.\n",
       "Men meeting him in the walk gave him wide berth. In front of Bevin's\n",
       "store a crowd melted apart for his passage, and their faces and whispers\n",
       "were faces and whispers of a dream. He turned a corner to meet Tull\n",
       "face to face, eye to eye. As once before he had seen this man pale to\n",
       "a ghastly, livid white so again he saw the change. Tull stopped in his\n",
       "tracks, with right hand raised and shaking. Suddenly it dropped, and he\n",
       "seemed to glide aside, to pass out of Venters's sight. Next he saw\n",
       "many horses with bridles down--all clean-limbed, dark bays or\n",
       "blacks--rustlers' horses! Loud voices and boisterous laughter, rattle of\n",
       "dice and scrape of chair and clink of gold, burst in mingled din from an\n",
       "open doorway. He stepped inside.\n",
       "\n",
       "With the sight of smoke-hazed room and drinking, cursing, gambling,\n",
       "dark-visaged men, reality once more dawned upon Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "His entrance had been unnoticed, and he bent his gaze upon the drinkers\n",
       "at the bar. Dark-clothed, dark-faced men they all were, burned by the\n",
       "sun, bow-legged as were most riders of the sage, but neither lean nor\n",
       "gaunt. Then Venters's gaze passed to the tables, and swiftly it swept\n",
       "over the hard-featured gamesters, to alight upon the huge, shaggy, black\n",
       "head of the rustler chief.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oldring!” he cried, and to him his voice seemed to split a bell in his\n",
       "ears.\n",
       "\n",
       "It stilled the din.\n",
       "\n",
       "That silence suddenly broke to the scrape and crash of Oldring's chair\n",
       "as he rose; and then, while he passed, a great gloomy figure, again the\n",
       "thronged room stilled in silence yet deeper.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oldring, a word with you!” continued Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ho! What's this?” boomed Oldring, in frowning scrutiny.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Come outside, alone. A word for you--from your Masked Rider!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Oldring kicked a chair out of his way and lunged forward with a stamp\n",
       "of heavy boot that jarred the floor. He waved down his muttering, rising\n",
       "men.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters backed out of the door and waited, hearing, as no sound had ever\n",
       "before struck into his soul, the rapid, heavy steps of the rustler.\n",
       "\n",
       "Oldring appeared, and Venters had one glimpse of his great breadth and\n",
       "bulk, his gold-buckled belt with hanging guns, his high-top boots\n",
       "with gold spurs. In that moment Venters had a strange, unintelligible\n",
       "curiosity to see Oldring alive. The rustler's broad brow, his large\n",
       "black eyes, his sweeping beard, as dark as the wing of a raven, his\n",
       "enormous width of shoulder and depth of chest, his whole splendid\n",
       "presence so wonderfully charged with vitality and force and strength,\n",
       "seemed to afford Venters an unutterable fiendish joy because for that\n",
       "magnificent manhood and life he meant cold and sudden death.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oldring, Bess is alive! But she's dead to you--dead to the life you\n",
       "made her lead--dead as you will be in one second!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Swift as lightning Venters's glance dropped from Oldring's rolling\n",
       "eyes to his hands. One of them, the right, swept out, then toward his\n",
       "gun--and Venters shot him through the heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "Slowly Oldring sank to his knees, and the hand, dragging at the gun,\n",
       "fell away. Venters's strangely acute faculties grasped the meaning\n",
       "of that limp arm, of the swaying hulk, of the gasp and heave, of the\n",
       "quivering beard. But was that awful spirit in the black eyes only one of\n",
       "vitality?\n",
       "\n",
       "“Man--why--didn't--you--wait? Bess--was--” Oldring's whisper died under\n",
       "his beard, and with a heavy lurch he fell forward.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bounding swiftly away, Venters fled around the corner, across the\n",
       "street, and, leaping a hedge, he ran through yard, orchard, and garden\n",
       "to the sage. Here, under cover of the tall brush, he turned west and ran\n",
       "on to the place where he had hidden his rifle. Securing that, he again\n",
       "set out into a run, and, circling through the sage, came up behind Jane\n",
       "Withersteen's stable and corrals. With laboring, dripping chest, and\n",
       "pain as of a knife thrust in his side, he stopped to regain his breath,\n",
       "and while resting his eyes roved around in search of a horse. Doors\n",
       "and windows of the stable were open wide and had a deserted look. One\n",
       "dejected, lonely burro stood in the near corral. Strange indeed was the\n",
       "silence brooding over the once happy, noisy home of Jane Withersteen's\n",
       "pets.\n",
       "\n",
       "He went into the corral, exercising care to leave no tracks, and led the\n",
       "burro to the watering-trough. Venters, though not thirsty, drank till he\n",
       "could drink no more. Then, leading the burro over hard ground, he struck\n",
       "into the sage and down the slope.\n",
       "\n",
       "He strode swiftly, turning from time to time to scan the slope for\n",
       "riders. His head just topped the level of sage-brush, and the burro\n",
       "could not have been seen at all. Slowly the green of Cottonwoods sank\n",
       "behind the slope, and at last a wavering line of purple sage met the\n",
       "blue of sky.\n",
       "\n",
       "To avoid being seen, to get away, to hide his trail--these were the sole\n",
       "ideas in his mind as he headed for Deception Pass, and he directed all\n",
       "his acuteness of eye and ear, and the keenness of a rider's judgment for\n",
       "distance and ground, to stern accomplishment of the task. He kept to the\n",
       "sage far to the left of the trail leading into the Pass. He walked ten\n",
       "miles and looked back a thousand times. Always the graceful, purple wave\n",
       "of sage remained wide and lonely, a clear, undotted waste. Coming to a\n",
       "stretch of rocky ground, he took advantage of it to cross the trail and\n",
       "then continued down on the right. At length he persuaded himself that he\n",
       "would be able to see riders mounted on horses before they could see him\n",
       "on the little burro, and he rode bareback.\n",
       "\n",
       "Hour by hour the tireless burro kept to his faithful, steady trot. The\n",
       "sun sank and the long shadows lengthened down the slope. Moving veils of\n",
       "purple twilight crept out of the hollows and, mustering and forming on\n",
       "the levels, soon merged and shaded into night. Venters guided the\n",
       "burro nearer to the trail, so that he could see its white line from the\n",
       "ridges, and rode on through the hours.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once down in the Pass without leaving a trail, he would hold himself\n",
       "safe for the time being. When late in the night he reached the break in\n",
       "the sage, he sent the burro down ahead of him, and started an avalanche\n",
       "that all but buried the animal at the bottom of the trail. Bruised and\n",
       "battered as he was, he had a moment's elation, for he had hidden his\n",
       "tracks. Once more he mounted the burro and rode on. The hour was the\n",
       "blackest of the night when he made the thicket which inclosed his old\n",
       "camp. Here he turned the burro loose in the grass near the spring, and\n",
       "then lay down on his old bed of leaves.\n",
       "\n",
       "He felt only vaguely, as outside things, the ache and burn and throb\n",
       "of the muscles of his body. But a dammed-up torrent of emotion at last\n",
       "burst its bounds, and the hour that saw his release from immediate\n",
       "action was one that confounded him in the reaction of his spirit. He\n",
       "suffered without understanding why. He caught glimpses into himself,\n",
       "into unlit darkness of soul. The fire that had blistered him and the\n",
       "cold which had frozen him now united in one torturing possession of his\n",
       "mind and heart, and like a fiery steed with ice-shod feet, ranged his\n",
       "being, ran rioting through his blood, trampling the resurging good,\n",
       "dragging ever at the evil.\n",
       "\n",
       "Out of the subsiding chaos came a clear question. What had happened?\n",
       "He had left the valley to go to Cottonwoods. Why? It seemed that he had\n",
       "gone to kill a man--Oldring! The name riveted his consciousness upon the\n",
       "one man of all men upon earth whom he had wanted to meet. He had met the\n",
       "rustler. Venters recalled the smoky haze of the saloon, the dark-visaged\n",
       "men, the huge Oldring. He saw him step out of the door, a splendid\n",
       "specimen of manhood, a handsome giant with purple-black and sweeping\n",
       "beard. He remembered inquisitive gaze of falcon eyes. He heard himself\n",
       "repeating: “OLDRING, BESS IS ALIVE! BUT SHE'S DEAD TO YOU,” and he felt\n",
       "himself jerk, and his ears throbbed to the thunder of a gun, and he\n",
       "saw the giant sink slowly to his knees. Was that only the vitality\n",
       "of him--that awful light in the eyes--only the hard-dying life of\n",
       "a tremendously powerful brute? A broken whisper, strange as death:\n",
       "“MAN--WHY--DIDN'T--YOU WAIT! BESS--WAS--” And Oldring plunged face\n",
       "forward, dead.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I killed him,” cried Venters, in remembering shock. “But it wasn't\n",
       "THAT. Ah, the look in his eyes and his whisper!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Herein lay the secret that had clamored to him through all the tumult\n",
       "and stress of his emotions. What a look in the eyes of a man shot\n",
       "through the heart! It had been neither hate nor ferocity nor fear of\n",
       "men nor fear of death. It had been no passionate glinting spirit of a\n",
       "fearless foe, willing shot for shot, life for life, but lacking physical\n",
       "power. Distinctly recalled now, never to be forgotten, Venters saw\n",
       "in Oldring's magnificent eyes the rolling of great, glad\n",
       "surprise--softness--love! Then came a shadow and the terrible superhuman\n",
       "striving of his spirit to speak. Oldring shot through the heart, had\n",
       "fought and forced back death, not for a moment in which to shoot or\n",
       "curse, but to whisper strange words.\n",
       "\n",
       "What words for a dying man to whisper! Why had not Venters waited? For\n",
       "what? That was no plea for life. It was regret that there was not a\n",
       "moment of life left in which to speak. Bess was--Herein lay renewed\n",
       "torture for Venters. What had Bess been to Oldring? The old question,\n",
       "like a specter, stalked from its grave to haunt him. He had overlooked,\n",
       "he had forgiven, he had loved and he had forgotten; and now, out of the\n",
       "mystery of a dying man's whisper rose again that perverse, unsatisfied,\n",
       "jealous uncertainty. Bess had loved that splendid, black-crowned\n",
       "giant--by her own confession she had loved him; and in Venters's soul\n",
       "again flamed up the jealous hell. Then into the clamoring hell burst the\n",
       "shot that had killed Oldring, and it rang in a wild fiendish gladness,\n",
       "a hateful, vengeful joy. That passed to the memory of the love and\n",
       "light in Oldring's eyes and the mystery in his whisper. So the changing,\n",
       "swaying emotions fluctuated in Venters's heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "This was the climax of his year of suffering and the crucial struggle\n",
       "of his life. And when the gray dawn came he rose, a gloomy, almost\n",
       "heartbroken man, but victor over evil passions. He could not change the\n",
       "past; and, even if he had not loved Bess with all his soul, he had grown\n",
       "into a man who would not change the future he had planned for her. Only,\n",
       "and once for all, he must know the truth, know the worst, stifle all\n",
       "these insistent doubts and subtle hopes and jealous fancies, and kill\n",
       "the past by knowing truly what Bess had been to Oldring. For that matter\n",
       "he knew--he had always known, but he must hear it spoken. Then, when\n",
       "they had safely gotten out of that wild country to take up a new and an\n",
       "absorbing life, she would forget, she would be happy, and through that,\n",
       "in the years to come, he could not but find life worth living.\n",
       "\n",
       "All day he rode slowly and cautiously up the Pass, taking time to peer\n",
       "around corners, to pick out hard ground and grassy patches, and to make\n",
       "sure there was no one in pursuit. In the night sometime he came to the\n",
       "smooth, scrawled rocks dividing the valley, and here set the burro at\n",
       "liberty. He walked beyond, climbed the slope and the dim, starlit gorge.\n",
       "Then, weary to the point of exhaustion, he crept into a shallow cave and\n",
       "fell asleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the morning, when he descended the trail, he found the sun was\n",
       "pouring a golden stream of light through the arch of the great stone\n",
       "bridge. Surprise Valley, like a valley of dreams, lay mystically soft\n",
       "and beautiful, awakening to the golden flood which was rolling away its\n",
       "slumberous bands of mist, brightening its walled faces.\n",
       "\n",
       "While yet far off he discerned Bess moving under the silver spruces, and\n",
       "soon the barking of the dogs told him that they had seen him. He heard\n",
       "the mocking-birds singing in the trees, and then the twittering of the\n",
       "quail. Ring and Whitie came bounding toward him, and behind them ran\n",
       "Bess, her hands outstretched.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern! You're back! You're back!” she cried, in joy that rang of her\n",
       "loneliness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes, I'm back,” he said, as she rushed to meet him.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had reached out for him when suddenly, as she saw him closely,\n",
       "something checked her, and as quickly all her joy fled, and with it her\n",
       "color, leaving her pale and trembling.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh! What's happened?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“A good deal has happened, Bess. I don't need to tell you what. And I'm\n",
       "played out. Worn out in mind more than body.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Dear--you look strange to me!” faltered Bess.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Never mind that. I'm all right. There's nothing for you to be scared\n",
       "about. Things are going to turn out just as we have planned. As soon as\n",
       "I'm rested we'll make a break to get out of the country. Only now, right\n",
       "now, I must know the truth about you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Truth about me?” echoed Bess, shrinkingly. She seemed to be casting\n",
       "back into her mind for a forgotten key. Venters himself, as he saw her,\n",
       "received a pang.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes--the truth. Bess, don't misunderstand. I haven't changed that way.\n",
       "I love you still. I'll love you more afterward. Life will be just as\n",
       "sweet--sweeter to us. We'll be--be married as soon as ever we can. We'll\n",
       "be happy--but there's a devil in me. A perverse, jealous devil! Then\n",
       "I've queer fancies. I forgot for a long time. Now all those fiendish\n",
       "little whispers of doubt and faith and fear and hope come torturing me\n",
       "again. I've got to kill them with the truth.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'll tell you anything you want to know,” she replied, frankly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Then by Heaven! we'll have it over and done with!... Bess--did Oldring\n",
       "love you?”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“How can you tell it so lightly?” cried Venters, passionately. “Haven't\n",
       "you any sense of--of--” He choked back speech. He felt the rush of pain\n",
       "and passion. He seized her in rude, strong hands and drew her close. He\n",
       "looked straight into her dark-blue eyes. They were shadowing with the\n",
       "old wistful light, but they were as clear as the limpid water of the\n",
       "spring. They were earnest, solemn in unutterable love and faith and\n",
       "abnegation. Venters shivered. He knew he was looking into her soul.\n",
       "He knew she could not lie in that moment; but that she might tell the\n",
       "truth, looking at him with those eyes, almost killed his belief in\n",
       "purity.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What are--what were you to--to Oldring?” he panted, fiercely.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I am his daughter,” she replied, instantly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters slowly let go of her. There was a violent break in the force of\n",
       "his feeling--then creeping blankness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What--was it--you said?” he asked, in a kind of dull wonder.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I am his daughter.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oldring's daughter?” queried Venters, with life gathering in his voice.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "With a passionately awakening start he grasped her hands and drew her\n",
       "close.\n",
       "\n",
       "“All the time--you've been Oldring's daughter?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes, of course all the time--always.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“But Bess, you told me--you let me think--I made out you were--a--so--so\n",
       "ashamed.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“It is my shame,” she said, with voice deep and full, and now the\n",
       "scarlet fired her cheek. “I told you--I'm nothing--nameless--just Bess,\n",
       "Oldring's girl!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I know--I remember. But I never thought--” he went on, hurriedly,\n",
       "huskily. “That time--when you lay dying--you prayed--you--somehow I got\n",
       "the idea you were bad.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bad?” she asked, with a little laugh.\n",
       "\n",
       "She looked up with a faint smile of bewilderment and the absolute\n",

       "\n",
       "“Bess! Bess!” He clasped her in his arms, hiding her eyes against his\n",
       "breast. She must not see his face in that moment. And he held her while\n",
       "he looked out across the valley. In his dim and blinded sight, in\n",
       "the blur of golden light and moving mist, he saw Oldring. She was the\n",
       "rustler's nameless daughter. Oldring had loved her. He had so guarded\n",
       "her, so kept her from women and men and knowledge of life that her mind\n",
       "was as a child's. That was part of the secret--part of the mystery.\n",
       "That was the wonderful truth. Not only was she not bad, but good, pure,\n",
       "innocent above all innocence in the world--the innocence of lonely\n",
       "girlhood.\n",
       "\n",
       "He saw Oldring's magnificent eyes, inquisitive, searching, softening. He\n",
       "saw them flare in amaze, in gladness, with love, then suddenly strain in\n",
       "terrible effort of will. He heard Oldring whisper and saw him sway like\n",
       "a log and fall. Then a million bellowing, thundering voices--gunshots of\n",
       "conscience, thunderbolts of remorse--dinned horribly in his ears. He had\n",
       "killed Bess's father. Then a rushing wind filled his ears like a moan of\n",
       "wind in the cliffs, a knell indeed--Oldring's knell.\n",
       "\n",
       "He dropped to his knees and hid his face against Bess, and grasped her\n",
       "with the hands of a drowning man.\n",
       "\n",
       "“My God!... My God!... Oh, Bess!... Forgive me! Never mind what I've\n",
       "done--what I've thought. But forgive me. I'll give you my life. I'll\n",
       "live for you. I'll love you. Oh, I do love you as no man ever loved\n",
       "a woman. I want you to know--to remember that I fought a fight for\n",
       "you--however blind I was. I thought--I thought--never mind what I\n",
       "thought--but I loved you--I asked you to marry me. Let that--let me have\n",
       "that to hug to my heart. Oh, Bess, I was driven! And I might have known!\n",
       "I could not rest nor sleep till I had this mystery solved. God! how\n",
       "things work out!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern, you're weak--trembling--you talk wildly,” cried Bess. “You've\n",

       "except your love for me. You have come back to me!”\n",

       "\n",
       "Lassiter, who was as serious with Fay as he was gentle and loving,\n",
       "assured her in earnest and elaborate speech that he was her devoted\n",

       "of men or searching for a supreme test to prove this cavalier.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Does oo love my new muvver?” she asked, with bewildering suddenness.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane Withersteen laughed, and for the first time in many a day she felt\n",
       "a stir of her pulse and warmth in her cheek.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a still drowsy summer of afternoon, and the three were sitting\n",
       "in the shade of the wooded knoll that faced the sage-slope. Little Fay's\n",
       "brief spell of unhappy longing for her mother--the childish, mystic\n",
       "gloom--had passed, and now where Fay was there were prattle and laughter\n",
       "and glee. She had emerged from sorrow to be the incarnation of joy and\n",
       "loveliness. She had grown supernaturally sweet and beautiful. For Jane\n",
       "Withersteen the child was an answer to prayer, a blessing, a possession\n",

       "\n",
       "“Why?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Because,” replied Jane. And she found it strangely embarrassing to meet\n",

       "scarcely turning a fragile blade, and she had dreamed beside some old\n",

       "it over the one he habitually wore his hands became steady. This second\n",

       "a miracle. Every few steps he answered to the strange, nervous fear and\n",
       "turned to make sure the rock still stood like a giant statue. And, as\n",
       "he descended, it grew dimmer in his sight. It changed form; it swayed it\n",
       "nodded darkly; and at last, in his heightened fancy, he saw it heave and\n",
       "roll. As in a dream when he felt himself falling yet knew he would never\n",
       "fall, so he saw this long-standing thunderbolt of the little stone-men\n",
       "plunge down to close forever the outlet to Deception Pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "And while he was giving way to unaccountable dread imaginations the\n",
       "descent was accomplished without mishap.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm glad that's over,” he said, breathing more freely. “I hope I'm by\n",
       "that hanging rock for good and all. Since almost the moment I first saw\n",
       "it I've had an idea that it was waiting for me. Now, when it does fall,\n",
       "if I'm thousands of miles away, I'll hear it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "With the first glimpses of the smooth slope leading down to the\n",
       "grotesque cedars and out to the Pass, Venters's cool nerve returned. One\n",
       "long survey to the left, then one to the right, satisfied his caution.\n",
       "Leading the burros down to the spur of rock, he halted at the steep\n",
       "incline.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess, here's the bad place, the place I told you about, with the cut\n",
       "steps. You start down, leading your burro. Take your time and hold on to\n",
       "him if you slip. I've got a rope on him and a half-hitch on this point\n",
       "of rock, so I can let him down safely. Coming up here was a killing job.\n",
       "But it'll be easy going down.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Both burros passed down the difficult stairs cut by the cliff-dwellers,\n",
       "and did it without a misstep. After that the descent down the slope and\n",
       "over the mile of scrawled, ripped, and ridged rock required only careful\n",
       "guidance, and Venters got the burros to level ground in a condition that\n",
       "caused him to congratulate himself.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, if we only had Wrangle!” exclaimed Venters. “But we're lucky.\n",
       "That's the worst of our trail passed. We've only men to fear now. If we\n",
       "get up in the sage we can hide and slip along like coyotes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "They mounted and rode west through the valley and entered the canyon.\n",
       "From time to time Venters walked, leading his burro. When they got by\n",
       "all the canyons and gullies opening into the Pass they went faster and\n",
       "with fewer halts. Venters did not confide in Bess the alarming fact that\n",
       "he had seen horses and smoke less than a mile up one of the intersecting\n",
       "canyons. He did not talk at all. And long after he had passed this\n",
       "canyon and felt secure once more in the certainty that they had been\n",
       "unobserved he never relaxed his watchfulness. But he did not walk any\n",
       "more, and he kept the burros at a steady trot. Night fell before they\n",
       "reached the last water in the Pass and they made camp by starlight.\n",
       "Venters did not want the burros to stray, so he tied them with long\n",
       "halters in the grass near the spring. Bess, tired out and silent, laid\n",
       "her head in a saddle and went to sleep between the two dogs. Venters\n",
       "did not close his eyes. The canyon silence appeared full of the low,\n",
       "continuous hum of insects. He listened until the hum grew into a roar,\n",
       "and then, breaking the spell, once more he heard it low and clear. He\n",
       "watched the stars and the moving shadows, and always his glance returned\n",
       "to the girl's dimly pale face. And he remembered how white and still\n",
       "it had once looked in the starlight. And again stern thought fought his\n",
       "strange fancies. Would all his labor and his love be for naught? Would\n",
       "he lose her, after all? What did the dark shadow around her portend? Did\n",
       "calamity lurk on that long upland trail through the sage? Why should his\n",
       "heart swell and throb with nameless fear? He listened to the silence\n",
       "and told himself that in the broad light of day he could dispel this\n",
       "leaden-weighted dread.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the first hint of gray over the eastern rim he awoke Bess, saddled\n",
       "the burros, and began the day's travel. He wanted to get out of the Pass\n",
       "before there was any chance of riders coming down. They gained the break\n",
       "as the first red rays of the rising sun colored the rim.\n",
       "\n",
       "For once, so eager was he to get up to level ground, he did not send\n",
       "Ring or Whitie in advance. Encouraging Bess to hurry pulling at his\n",
       "patient, plodding burro, he climbed the soft, steep trail.\n",
       "\n",
       "Brighter and brighter grew the light. He mounted the last broken edge of\n",
       "rim to have the sun-fired, purple sage-slope burst upon him as a glory.\n",
       "Bess panted up to his side, tugging on the halter of her burro.\n",
       "\n",
       "“We're up!” he cried, joyously. “There's not a dot on the sage. We're\n",
       "safe. We'll not be seen! Oh, Bess--”\n",
       "\n",
       "Ring growled and sniffed the keen air and bristled. Venters clutched\n",
       "at his rifle. Whitie sometimes made a mistake, but Ring never. The dull\n",
       "thud of hoofs almost deprived Venters of power to turn and see from\n",
       "where disaster threatened. He felt his eyes dilate as he stared at\n",
       "Lassiter leading Black Star and Night out of the sage, with Jane\n",
       "Withersteen, in rider's costume, close beside them.\n",
       "\n",
       "For an instant Venters felt himself whirl dizzily in the center of vast\n",
       "circles of sage. He recovered partially, enough to see Lassiter standing\n",
       "with a glad smile and Jane riveted in astonishment.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why, Bern!” she exclaimed. “How good it is to see you! We're riding\n",
       "away, you see. The storm burst--and I'm a ruined woman!... I thought you\n",
       "were alone.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters, unable to speak for consternation, and bewildered out of all\n",
       "sense of what he ought or ought not to do, simply stared at Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Son, where are you bound for?” asked Lassiter.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Not safe--where I was. I'm--we're going out of Utah--back East,” he\n",
       "found tongue to say.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon this meetin's the luckiest thing that ever happened to you an'\n",
       "to me--an' to Jane--an' to Bess,” said Lassiter, coolly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess!” cried Jane, with a sudden leap of blood to her pale cheek.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was entirely beyond Venters to see any luck in that meeting.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane Withersteen took one flashing, woman's glance at Bess's scarlet\n",
       "face, at her slender, shapely form.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Venters! is this a girl--a woman?” she questioned, in a voice that\n",
       "stung.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Did you have her in that wonderful valley?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes, but Jane--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“All the time you were gone?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes, but I couldn't tell--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Was it for her you asked me to give you supplies? Was it for her that\n",
       "you wanted to make your valley a paradise?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh--Jane--”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“Yes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, you liar!” And with these passionate words Jane Withersteen\n",
       "succumbed to fury. For the second time in her life she fell into the\n",
       "ungovernable rage that had been her father's weakness. And it was worse\n",
       "than his, for she was a jealous woman--jealous even of her friends.\n",
       "\n",
       "As best he could, he bore the brunt of her anger. It was not only his\n",
       "deceit to her that she visited upon him, but her betrayal by religion,\n",
       "by life itself.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her passion, like fire at white heat, consumed itself in little time.\n",
       "Her physical strength failed, and still her spirit attempted to go on in\n",
       "magnificent denunciation of those who had wronged her. Like a tree\n",
       "cut deep into its roots, she began to quiver and shake, and her anger\n",
       "weakened into despair. And her ringing voice sank into a broken, husky\n",
       "whisper. Then, spent and pitiable, upheld by Lassiter's arm, she turned\n",
       "and hid her face in Black Star's mane.\n",
       "\n",
       "Numb as Venters was when at length Jane Withersteen lifted her head and\n",
       "looked at him, he yet suffered a pang.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, the girl is innocent!” he cried.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Can you expect me to believe that?” she asked, with weary, bitter eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm not that kind of a liar. And you know it. If I lied--if I kept\n",
       "silent when honor should have made me speak, it was to spare you. I came\n",
       "to Cottonwoods to tell you. But I couldn't add to your pain. I intended\n",
       "to tell you I had come to love this girl. But, Jane I hadn't forgotten\n",
       "how good you were to me. I haven't changed at all toward you. I prize\n",
       "your friendship as I always have. But, however it may look to you--don't\n",

       "\n",
       "“Jane, she's jest as sweet an' innocent as little Fay,” said Lassiter.\n",
       "There was a faint smile upon his face and a beautiful light.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters saw, and knew that Lassiter saw, how Jane Withersteen's tortured\n",
       "soul wrestled with hate and threw it--with scorn doubt, suspicion, and\n",
       "overcame all.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern, if in my misery I accused you unjustly, I crave forgiveness,” she\n",
       "said. “I'm not what I once was. Tell me--who is this girl?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, she is Oldring's daughter, and his Masked Rider. Lassiter will\n",
       "tell you how I shot her for a rustler, saved her life--all the story.\n",
       "It's a strange story, Jane, as wild as the sage. But it's true--true as\n",
       "her innocence. That you must believe.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oldring's Masked Rider! Oldring's daughter!” exclaimed Jane “And she's\n",
       "innocent! You ask me to believe much. If this girl is--is what you say,\n",
       "how could she be going away with the man who killed her father?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why did you tell that?” cried Venters, passionately.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane's question had roused Bess out of stupefaction. Her eyes suddenly\n",
       "darkened and dilated. She stepped toward Venters and held up both hands\n",
       "as if to ward off a blow.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Did--did you kill Oldring?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I did, Bess, and I hate myself for it. But you know I never dreamed\n",
       "he was your father. I thought he'd wronged you. I killed him when I was\n",
       "madly jealous.”\n",
       "\n",
       "For a moment Bess was shocked into silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "“But he was my father!” she broke out, at last. “And now I must go\n",
       "back--I can't go with you. It's all over--that beautiful dream. Oh, I\n",
       "knew it couldn't come true. You can't take me now.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“If you forgive me, Bess, it'll all come right in the end!” implored\n",
       "Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It can't be right. I'll go back. After all, I loved him. He was good to\n",

       "\n",
       "“If you go back to Oldring's men I'll follow you, and then they'll kill\n",

       "\n",
       "“Oh no, Bern, you'll not come. Let me go. It's best for you to forget\n",
       "me. I've brought you only pain and dishonor.”\n",
       "\n",
       "She did not weep. But the sweet bloom and life died out of her face.\n",
       "She looked haggard and sad, all at once stunted; and her hands dropped\n",
       "listlessly; and her head drooped in slow, final acceptance of a hopeless\n",
       "fate.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, look there!” cried Venters, in despairing grief. “Need you have\n",
       "told her? Where was all your kindness of heart? This girl has had a\n",
       "wretched, lonely life. And I'd found a way to make her happy. You've\n",

       "sure as you breathe.”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Lassiter suddenly moved forward, and with the beautiful light on his\n",

       "\n",
       "“Well, I reckon you've all had your say, an' now it's Lassiter's turn.\n",
       "Why, I was jest praying for this meetin'. Bess, jest look here.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Gently he touched her arm and turned her to face the others, and then\n",
       "outspread his great hand to disclose a shiny, battered gold locket.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Open it,” he said, with a singularly rich voice.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bess complied, but listlessly.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Jane, after one glance, drew back.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Venters, with tingling pulse, with something growing on him, recognized\n",
       "in the faded miniature portrait the eyes of Milly Erne.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes, that's Milly,” said Lassiter, softly. “Bess, did you ever see her\n",

       "\n",
       "“The eyes seem to haunt me,” whispered Bess. “Oh, I can't\n",
       "remember--they're eyes of my dreams--but--but--”\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter's strong arm went round her and he bent his head.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Child, I thought you'd remember her eyes. They're the same beautiful\n",
       "eyes you'd see if you looked in a mirror or a clear spring. They're your\n",
       "mother's eyes. You are Milly Erne's child. Your name is Elizabeth Erne.\n",
       "You're not Oldring's daughter. You're the daughter of Frank Erne, a man\n",
       "once my best friend. Look! Here's his picture beside Milly's. He was\n",
       "handsome, an' as fine an' gallant a Southern gentleman as I ever seen.\n",
       "Frank came of an old family. You come of the best of blood, lass, and\n",
       "blood tells.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Bess slipped through his arm to her knees and hugged the locket to her\n",

       "\n",
       "“It--can't--be--true!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Thank God, lass, it is true,” replied Lassiter. “Jane an' Bern\n",
       "here--they both recognize Milly. They see Milly in you. They're so\n",
       "knocked out they can't tell you, that's all.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Who are you?” whispered Bess.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon I'm Milly's brother an' your uncle!... Uncle Jim! Ain't that\n",
       "fine?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, I can't believe--Don't raise me! Bern, let me kneel. I see truth\n",

       "knees. Tell me how it's true!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, Elizabeth, listen,” said Lassiter. “Before you was born your\n",
       "father made a mortal enemy of a Mormon named Dyer. They was both\n",
       "ministers an' come to be rivals. Dyer stole your mother away from her\n",
       "home. She gave birth to you in Texas eighteen years ago. Then she was\n",
       "taken to Utah, from place to place, an' finally to the last border\n",
       "settlement--Cottonwoods. You was about three years old when you was\n",
       "taken away from Milly. She never knew what had become of you. But she\n",
       "lived a good while hopin' and prayin' to have you again. Then she gave\n",
       "up an' died. An' I may as well put in here your father died ten years\n",
       "ago. Well, I spent my time tracin' Milly, an' some months back I landed\n",
       "in Cottonwoods. An' jest lately I learned all about you. I had a talk\n",
       "with Oldrin' an' told him you was dead, an' he told me what I had so\n",
       "long been wantin' to know. It was Dyer, of course, who stole you from\n",
       "Milly. Part reason he was sore because Milly refused to give you Mormon\n",
       "teachin', but mostly he still hated Frank Erne so infernally that he\n",
       "made a deal with Oldrin' to take you an' bring you up as an infamous\n",
       "rustler an' rustler's girl. The idea was to break Frank Erne's heart\n",
       "if he ever came to Utah--to show him his daughter with a band of low\n",
       "rustlers. Well--Oldrin' took you, brought you up from childhood, an'\n",
       "then made you his Masked Rider. He made you infamous. He kept that part\n",
       "of the contract, but he learned to love you as a daughter an' never let\n",
       "any but his own men know you was a girl. I heard him say that with my\n",
       "own ears, an' I saw his big eyes grow dim. He told me how he had guarded\n",
       "you always, kept you locked up in his absence, was always at your side\n",
       "or near you on those rides that made you famous on the sage. He said he\n",
       "an' an old rustler whom he trusted had taught you how to read an' write.\n",
       "They selected the books for you. Dyer had wanted you brought up the\n",
       "vilest of the vile! An' Oldrin' brought you up the innocentest of the\n",
       "innocent. He said you didn't know what vileness was. I can hear his big\n",
       "voice tremble now as he said it. He told me how the men--rustlers an'\n",
       "outlaws--who from time to time tried to approach you familiarly--he told\n",
       "me how he shot them dead. I'm tellin' you this 'specially because you've\n",
       "showed such shame--sayin' you was nameless an' all that. Nothin' on\n",
       "earth can be wronger than that idea of yours. An' the truth of it is\n",
       "here. Oldrin' swore to me that if Dyer died, releasin' the contract,\n",
       "he intended to hunt up your father an' give you back to him. It seems\n",
       "Oldrin' wasn't all bad, en' he sure loved you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters leaned forward in passionate remorse.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, Bess! I know Lassiter speaks the truth. For when I shot Oldring he\n",
       "dropped to his knees and fought with unearthly power to speak. And he\n",
       "said: 'Man--why--didn't--you--wait? Bess was--' Then he fell dead.\n",
       "And I've been haunted by his look and words. Oh, Bess, what a strange,\n",
       "splendid thing for Oldring to do! It all seems impossible. But, dear,\n",
       "you really are not what you thought.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Elizabeth Erne!” cried Jane Withersteen. “I loved your mother and I see\n",
       "her in you!”\n",
       "\n",
       "What had been incredible from the lips of men became, in the tone,\n",
       "look, and gesture of a woman, a wonderful truth for Bess. With little\n",
       "tremblings of all her slender body she rocked to and fro on her knees.\n",
       "The yearning wistfulness of her eyes changed to solemn splendor of joy.\n",
       "She believed. She was realizing happiness. And as the process of thought\n",
       "was slow, so were the variations of her expression. Her eyes reflected\n",
       "the transformation of her soul. Dark, brooding, hopeless belief--clouds\n",
       "of gloom--drifted, paled, vanished in glorious light. An exquisite rose\n",
       "flush--a glow--shone from her face as she slowly began to rise from her\n",
       "knees. A spirit uplifted her. All that she had held as base dropped from\n",
       "her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters watched her in joy too deep for words. By it he divined\n",
       "something of what Lassiter's revelation meant to Bess, but he knew he\n",
       "could only faintly understand. That moment when she seemed to be lifted\n",
       "by some spiritual transfiguration was the most beautiful moment of his\n",
       "life. She stood with parted, quivering lips, with hands tightly clasping\n",
       "the locket to her heaving breast. A new conscious pride of worth\n",
       "dignified the old wild, free grace and poise.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Uncle Jim!” she said, tremulously, with a different smile from any\n",

       "\n",
       "Venters, feeling his eyes grow hot and wet, turned away, and found\n",
       "himself looking at Jane Withersteen. He had almost forgotten her\n",
       "presence. Tenderness and sympathy were fast hiding traces of her\n",
       "agitation. Venters read her mind--felt the reaction of her noble\n",
       "heart--saw the joy she was beginning to feel at the happiness of others.\n",
       "And suddenly blinded, choked by his emotions, he turned from her also.\n",
       "He knew what she would do presently; she would make some magnificent\n",
       "amend for her anger; she would give some manifestation of her love;\n",
       "probably all in a moment, as she had loved Milly Erne, so would she love\n",
       "Elizabeth Erne.\n",
       "\n",
       "“'Pears to me, folks, that we'd better talk a little serious now,”\n",
       " remarked Lassiter, at length. “Time flies.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“You're right,” replied Venters, instantly. “I'd forgotten\n",
       "time--place--danger. Lassiter, you're riding away. Jane's leaving\n",
       "Withersteen House?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Forever,” replied Jane.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“Ah! I knew it. I told Judkins--And Tull?” went on Venters,\n",
       "passionately.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Tull wasn't around when I broke loose. By now he's likely on our trail\n",

       "any longer. Even if we would be I'd take this chance to get her out.\n",
       "I want to marry her. She shall have some of the pleasures of life--see\n",
       "cities and people. We've gold--we'll be rich. Why, life opens sweet\n",

       "\n",
       "Venters felt a touch on his elbow. Jane stood beside him with a hand\n",
       "on his arm. She was smiling. Something radiated from her, and like an\n",

       "\n",
       "“Bern, you'd be right to die rather than not take Elizabeth out of\n",

       "\n",
       "“No, no! What are you doing?” he demanded, in a kind of fury. “I won't\n",

       "\n",
       "“Son--cool down,” returned Lassiter, in a voice he might have used to a\n",
       "child. But the grip with which he tore away Venters's grasping hands was\n",
       "that of a giant. “Listen--you fool boy! Jane's sized up the situation.\n",
       "The burros'll do for us. We'll sneak along an' hide. I'll take your dogs\n",
       "an' your rifle. Why, it's the trick. The blacks are yours, an' sure as I\n",
       "can throw a gun you're goin' to ride safe out of the sage.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane--stop him--please stop him,” gasped Venters. “I've lost my\n",
       "strength. I can't do--anything. This is hell for me! Can't you see that?\n",
       "I've ruined you--it was through me you lost all. You've only Black Star\n",

       "Then in the white, rapt face, in the unfathomable eyes, Venters saw Jane\n",
       "Withersteen in a supreme moment. This moment was one wherein she reached\n",
       "up to the height for which her noble soul had ever yearned. He, after\n",
       "disrupting the calm tenor of her peace, after bringing down on her head\n",
       "the implacable hostility of her churchmen, after teaching her a bitter\n",
       "lesson of life--he was to be her salvation. And he turned away again,\n",
       "this time shaken to the core of his soul. Jane Withersteen was the\n",
       "incarnation of selflessness. He experienced wonder and terror, exquisite\n",
       "pain and rapture. What were all the shocks life had dealt him compared\n",
       "to the thought of such loyal and generous friendship?\n",
       "\n",
       "And instantly, as if by some divine insight, he knew himself in the\n",
       "remaking--tried, found wanting; but stronger, better, surer--and he\n",
       "wheeled to Jane Withersteen, eager, joyous, passionate, wild, exalted.\n",
       "He bent to her; he left tears and kisses on her hands.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, I--I can't find words--now,” he said. “I'm beyond words. Only--I\n",
       "understand. And I'll take the blacks.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Don't be losin' no more time,” cut in Lassiter. “I ain't certain, but\n",
       "I think I seen a speck up the sage-slope. Mebbe I was mistaken. But,\n",
       "anyway, we must all be movin'. I've shortened the stirrups on Black\n",

       "village, then cut off in the sage an' go round to the trail. But you'll\n",
       "most likely meet riders with Tull. Jest keep right on till you're jest\n",
       "out of gunshot an' then make your cut-off into the sage. They'll ride\n",
       "after you, but it won't be no use. You can ride, an' Bess can ride.\n",
       "When you're out of reach turn on round to the west, an' hit the trail\n",
       "somewhere. Save the hosses all you can, but don't be afraid. Black Star\n",
       "and Night are good for a hundred miles before sundown, if you have to\n",
       "push them. You can get to Sterlin' by night if you want. But better make\n",
       "it along about to-morrow mornin'. When you get through the notch on the\n",

       "Stone Bridge. Keep away from them villages. You won't run no risk of\n",
       "meetin' any of Oldrin's rustlers from Sterlin' on. You'll find water in\n",

       "much used, en' it leads to Sterlin'. That's your trail. An' one thing\n",

       "Black Star and Night, answering to spur, swept swiftly westward along\n",
       "the white, slow-rising, sage-bordered trail. Venters heard a mournful\n",
       "howl from Ring, but Whitie was silent. The blacks settled into their\n",
       "fleet, long-striding gallop. The wind sweetly fanned Venters's hot face.\n",
       "From the summit of the first low-swelling ridge he looked back. Lassiter\n",
       "waved his hand; Jane waved her scarf. Venters replied by standing in his\n",
       "stirrups and holding high his sombrero. Then the dip of the ridge hid\n",
       "them. From the height of the next he turned once more. Lassiter, Jane,\n",
       "and the burros had disappeared. They had gone down into the Pass.\n",
       "Venters felt a sensation of irreparable loss.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern--look!” called Bess, pointing up the long slope.\n",
       "\n",
       "A small, dark, moving dot split the line where purple sage met blue sky.\n",
       "That dot was a band of riders.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Pull the black, Bess.”\n",
       "\n",
       "They slowed from gallop to canter, then to trot. The fresh and eager\n",

       "\n",
       "“Bern, Black Star has great eyesight.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I wonder if they're Tull's riders. They might be rustlers. But it's all\n",
       "the same to us.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The black dot grew to a dark patch moving under low dust clouds. It grew\n",
       "all the time, though very slowly. There were long periods when it was in\n",
       "plain sight, and intervals when it dropped behind the sage. The blacks\n",
       "trotted for half an hour, for another half-hour, and still the moving\n",
       "patch appeared to stay on the horizon line. Gradually, however, as time\n",
       "passed, it began to enlarge, to creep down the slope, to encroach upon\n",
       "the intervening distance.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess, what do you make them out?” asked Venters. “I don't think they're\n",
       "rustlers.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“They're sage-riders,” replied Bess. “I see a white horse and several\n",
       "grays. Rustlers seldom ride any horses but bays and blacks.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“That white horse is Tull's. Pull the black, Bess. I'll get down and\n",
       "cinch up. We're in for some riding. Are you afraid?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Not now,” answered the girl, smiling.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You needn't be. Bess, you don't weigh enough to make Black Star know\n",
       "you're on him. I won't be able to stay with you. You'll leave Tull and\n",
       "his riders as if they were standing still.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“How about you?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Never fear. If I can't stay with you I can still laugh at Tull.”\n",

       "\n",
       "“Yes. But we're too far yet for them to make out who we are. They'll\n",
       "recognize the blacks first. We've passed most of the ridges and the\n",
       "thickest sage. Now, when I give the word, let Black Star go and ride!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters calculated that a mile or more still intervened between them\n",
       "and the riders. They were approaching at a swift canter. Soon Venters\n",
       "recognized Tull's white horse, and concluded that the riders had\n",
       "likewise recognized Black Star and Night. But it would be impossible for\n",
       "Tull yet to see that the blacks were not ridden by Lassiter and Jane.\n",
       "Venters noted that Tull and the line of horsemen, perhaps ten or twelve\n",
       "in number, stopped several times and evidently looked hard down the\n",
       "slope. It must have been a puzzling circumstance for Tull. Venters\n",
       "laughed grimly at the thought of what Tull's rage would be when he\n",
       "finally discovered the trick. Venters meant to sheer out into the sage\n",
       "before Tull could possibly be sure who rode the blacks.\n",
       "\n",
       "The gap closed to a distance of half a mile. Tull halted. His riders\n",
       "came up and formed a dark group around him. Venters thought he saw him\n",
       "wave his arms and was certain of it when the riders dashed into the\n",
       "sage, to right and left of the trail. Tull had anticipated just the move\n",
       "held in mind by Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Now Bess!” shouted Venters. “Strike north. Go round those riders and\n",
       "turn west.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Black Star sailed over the low sage, and in a few leaps got into his\n",
       "stride and was running. Venters spurred Night after him. It was hard\n",
       "going in the sage. The horses could run as well there, but keen eyesight\n",
       "and judgment must constantly be used by the riders in choosing ground.\n",
       "And continuous swerving from aisle to aisle between the brush, and\n",
       "leaping little washes and mounds of the pack-rats, and breaking through\n",
       "sage, made rough riding. When Venters had turned into a long aisle he\n",
       "had time to look up at Tull's riders. They were now strung out into an\n",
       "extended line riding northeast. And, as Venters and Bess were holding\n",
       "due north, this meant, if the horses of Tull and his riders had the\n",
       "speed and the staying power, they would head the blacks and turn them\n",
       "back down the slope. Tull's men were not saving their mounts; they were\n",
       "driving them desperately. Venters feared only an accident to Black Star\n",
       "or Night, and skilful riding would mitigate possibility of that. One\n",
       "glance ahead served to show him that Bess could pick a course through\n",
       "the sage as well as he. She looked neither back nor at the running\n",
       "riders, and bent forward over Black Star's neck and studied the ground\n",
       "ahead.\n",
       "\n",
       "It struck Venters, presently, after he had glanced up from time to time,\n",
       "that Bess was drawing away from him as he had expected. He had, however,\n",
       "only thought of the light weight Black Star was carrying and of his\n",
       "superior speed; he saw now that the black was being ridden as never\n",
       "before, except when Jerry Card lost the race to Wrangle. How easily,\n",
       "gracefully, naturally, Bess sat her saddle! She could ride! Suddenly\n",
       "Venters remembered she had said she could ride. But he had not dreamed\n",
       "she was capable of such superb horsemanship. Then all at once, flashing\n",
       "over him, thrilling him, came the recollection that Bess was Oldring's\n",
       "Masked Rider.\n",

       "a horse. And he delved into his memory, recalling famous rides which he\n",

       "Masked Rider! Many times this strange rider, at once well known and\n",

       "of night raids, of pursuit, and then how the Masked Rider, swift as the\n",
       "wind, was gone in the sage! A fleet, dark horse--a slender, dark form--a\n",

       "he turned no more. They would go back to Lassiter's trail and follow it,\n",
       "and follow in vain. So Venters rode on, with the wind growing sweeter\n",
       "to taste and smell, and the purple sage richer and the sky bluer in his\n",
       "sight; and the song in his ears ringing. By and by Bess halted to wait\n",

       "Somehow Jane mounted; somehow found strength to hold the reins, to spur,\n",

       "through sage, into a narrow canyon where the rapid clatter of hoofs\n",
       "rapped sharply from the walls. The wind roared in her ears; the gleaming\n",

       "likewise. And the horses settled from hard, furious gallop into a\n",
       "long-striding, driving run. She had never ridden at anything like that\n",
       "pace; desperately she tried to get the swing of the horse, to be of some\n",
       "help to him in that race, to see the best of the ground and guide\n",
       "him into it. But she failed of everything except to keep her seat the\n",
       "saddle, and to spur and spur. At times she closed her eyes unable to\n",
       "bear sight of Fay's golden curls streaming in the wind. She could not\n",
       "pray; she could not rail; she no longer cared for herself. All of life,\n",
       "of good, of use in the world, of hope in heaven entered in Lassiter's\n",
       "ride with little Fay to safety. She would have tried to turn the\n",

       "of injuries, of the ride, of his burden. Yet how cool and gay he\n",
       "looked--how intrepid!\n",
       "\n",
       "The horses walked, trotted, galloped, ran, to fall again to walk. Hours\n",
       "sped or dragged. Time was an instant--an eternity. Jane Withersteen felt\n",

       "glistened. And then it seemed the sun vanished, the walls shaded, the\n",
       "sage paled. The horses walked--trotted--galloped--ran--to fall again\n",
       "to walk. Shadows gathered under shelving cliffs. The canyon turned,\n",
       "brightened, opened into a long, wide, wall-enclosed valley. Again the\n",

       "A last breaking run across the sage brought Lassiter's horse to a walk.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Jane looked back over the long stretch of sage, and found the narrow gap\n",
       "in the wall, out of which came a file of dark horses with a white horse\n",
       "in the lead. Sight of the riders acted upon Jane as a stimulant. The\n",
       "weight of cold, horrible terror lessened. And, gazing forward at the\n",
       "dogs, at Lassiter's limping horse, at the blood on his face, at the\n",
       "rocks growing nearer, last at Fay's golden hair, the ice left her veins,\n",
       "and slowly, strangely, she gained hold of strength that she believed\n",
       "would see her to the safety Lassiter promised. And, as she gazed,\n",
       "Lassiter's horse stumbled and fell.\n",
       "\n",
       "He swung his leg and slipped from the saddle.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, take the child,” he said, and lifted Fay up. Jane clasped her\n",
       "arms suddenly strong. “They're gainin',” went on Lassiter, as he watched\n",
       "the pursuing riders. “But we'll beat 'em yet.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Turning with Jane's bridle in his hand, he was about to start when he\n",
       "saw the saddle-bag on the fallen horse.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I've jest about got time,” he muttered, and with swift fingers that\n",
       "did not blunder or fumble he loosened the bag and threw it over his\n",
       "shoulder. Then he started to run, leading Jane's horse, and he ran, and\n",
       "trotted, and walked, and ran again. Close ahead now Jane saw a rise of\n",
       "bare rock. Lassiter reached it, searched along the base, and, finding\n",
       "a low place, dragged the weary horse up and over round, smooth stone.\n",
       "Looking backward, Jane saw Tull's white horse not a mile distant, with\n",
       "riders strung out in a long line behind him. Looking forward, she saw\n",
       "more valley to the right, and to the left a towering cliff. Lassiter\n",
       "pulled the horse and kept on.\n",
       "\n",
       "Little Fay lay in her arms with wide-open eyes--eyes which were still\n",
       "shadowed by pain, but no longer fixed, glazed in terror. The golden\n",
       "curls blew across Jane's lips; the little hands feebly clasped her arm;\n",
       "a ghost of a troubled, trustful smile hovered round the sweet lips. And\n",
       "Jane Withersteen awoke to the spirit of a lioness.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter was leading the horse up a smooth slope toward cedar trees of\n",
       "twisted and bleached appearance. Among these he halted.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, give me the girl en' get down,” he said. As if it wrenched him he\n",
       "unbuckled the empty black guns with a strange air of finality. He then\n",
       "received Fay in his arms and stood a moment looking backward. Tull's\n",
       "white horse mounted the ridge of round stone, and several bays or blacks\n",
       "followed. “I wonder what he'll think when he sees them empty guns. Jane,\n",
       "bring your saddle-bag and climb after me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "A glistening, wonderful bare slope, with little holes, swelled up and\n",
       "up to lose itself in a frowning yellow cliff. Jane closely watched her\n",
       "steps and climbed behind Lassiter. He moved slowly. Perhaps he was only\n",
       "husbanding his strength. But she saw drops of blood on the stone, and\n",
       "then she knew. They climbed and climbed without looking back. Her breast\n",
       "labored; she began to feel as if little points of fiery steel were\n",
       "penetrating her side into her lungs. She heard the panting of Lassiter\n",
       "and the quicker panting of the dogs.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Wait--here,” he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before her rose a bulge of stone, nicked with little cut steps, and\n",
       "above that a corner of yellow wall, and overhanging that a vast,\n",
       "ponderous cliff.\n",
       "\n",
       "The dogs pattered up, disappeared round the corner. Lassiter mounted\n",
       "the steps with Fay, and he swayed like a drunken man, and he too\n",
       "disappeared. But instantly he returned alone, and half ran, half slipped\n",
       "down to her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then from below pealed up hoarse shouts of angry men. Tull and several\n",
       "of his riders had reached the spot where Lassiter had parted with his\n",
       "guns.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You'll need that breath--mebbe!” said Lassiter, facing downward, with\n",
       "glittering eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Now, Jane, the last pull,” he went on. “Walk up them little steps. I'll\n",
       "follow an' steady you. Don't think. Jest go. Little Fay's above. Her\n",
       "eyes are open. She jest said to me, 'Where's muvver Jane?'”\n",
       "\n",
       "Without a fear or a tremor or a slip or a touch of Lassiter's hand Jane\n",
       "Withersteen walked up that ladder of cut steps.\n",
       "\n",
       "He pushed her round the corner of the wall. Fay lay, with wide staring\n",
       "eyes, in the shade of a gloomy wall. The dogs waited. Lassiter picked\n",
       "up the child and turned into a dark cleft. It zigzagged. It widened.\n",
       "It opened. Jane was amazed at a wonderfully smooth and steep incline\n",
       "leading up between ruined, splintered, toppling walls. A red haze\n",
       "from the setting sun filled this passage. Lassiter climbed with slow,\n",
       "measured steps, and blood dripped from him to make splotches on the\n",
       "white stone. Jane tried not to step in his blood, but was compelled, for\n",
       "she found no other footing. The saddle-bag began to drag her down; she\n",
       "gasped for breath, she thought her heart was bursting. Slower, slower\n",
       "yet the rider climbed, whistling as he breathed. The incline widened.\n",
       "Huge pinnacles and monuments of stone stood alone, leaning fearfully.\n",
       "Red sunset haze shone through cracks where the wall had split. Jane did\n",
       "not look high, but she felt the overshadowing of broken rims above.\n",
       "She felt that it was a fearful, menacing place. And she climbed on in\n",
       "heartrending effort. And she fell beside Lassiter and Fay at the top of\n",
       "the incline in a narrow, smooth divide.\n",
       "\n",
       "He staggered to his feet--staggered to a huge, leaning rock that rested\n",
       "on a small pedestal. He put his hand on it--the hand that had been shot\n",
       "through--and Jane saw blood drip from the ragged hole. Then he fell.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane--I--can't--do--it!” he whispered.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Roll the--stone!... All my--life I've loved--to roll stones--en' now\n",
       "I--can't!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What of it? You talk strangely. Why roll that stone?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I planned to--fetch you here--to roll this stone. See! It'll smash the\n",
       "crags--loosen the walls--close the outlet!”\n",
       "\n",
       "As Jane Withersteen gazed down that long incline, walled in by crumbling\n",
       "cliffs, awaiting only the slightest jar to make them fall asunder,\n",
       "she saw Tull appear at the bottom and begin to climb. A rider followed\n",
       "him--another--and another.\n",
       "\n",
       "“See! Tull! The riders!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes--they'll get us--now.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why? Haven't you strength left to roll the stone?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane--it ain't that--I've lost my nerve!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“You!... Lassiter!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I wanted to roll it--meant to--but I--can't. Venters's valley is down\n",
       "behind here. We could--live there. But if I roll the stone--we're shut\n",
       "in for always. I don't dare. I'm thinkin' of you!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter! Roll the stone!” she cried.\n",
       "\n",
       "He arose, tottering, but with set face, and again he placed the bloody\n",
       "hand on the Balancing Rock. Jane Withersteen gazed from him down the\n",
       "passageway. Tull was climbing. Almost, she thought, she saw his dark,\n",
       "relentless face. Behind him more riders climbed. What did they mean for\n",

       "\n",
       "Under all his deathly pallor, and the blood, and the iron of seared\n",

       "\n",
       "It stirred, it groaned, it grated, it moved, and with a slow grinding,\n",

       "CHAPTER I. LASSITER\n",
       "\n",
       "A sharp clip-crop of iron-shod hoofs deadened and died away, and clouds\n",
       "of yellow dust drifted from under the cottonwoods out over the sage.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane Withersteen gazed down the wide purple slope with dreamy and\n",
       "troubled eyes. A rider had just left her and it was his message that\n",
       "held her thoughtful and almost sad, awaiting the churchmen who were\n",
       "coming to resent and attack her right to befriend a Gentile.\n",
       "\n",
       "She wondered if the unrest and strife that had lately come to the\n",
       "little village of Cottonwoods was to involve her. And then she sighed,\n",
       "remembering that her father had founded this remotest border settlement\n",
       "of southern Utah and that he had left it to her. She owned all the\n",
       "ground and many of the cottages. Withersteen House was hers, and the\n",
       "great ranch, with its thousands of cattle, and the swiftest horses of\n",
       "the sage. To her belonged Amber Spring, the water which gave verdure\n",
       "and beauty to the village and made living possible on that wild purple\n",
       "upland waste. She could not escape being involved by whatever befell\n",
       "Cottonwoods.\n",
       "\n",
       "That year, 1871, had marked a change which had been gradually coming\n",
       "in the lives of the peace-loving Mormons of the border. Glaze--Stone\n",
       "Bridge--Sterling, villages to the north, had risen against the\n",
       "invasion of Gentile settlers and the forays of rustlers. There had been\n",
       "opposition to the one and fighting with the other. And now Cottonwoods\n",
       "had begun to wake and bestir itself and grown hard.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane prayed that the tranquillity and sweetness of her life would not be\n",
       "permanently disrupted. She meant to do so much more for her people than\n",
       "she had done. She wanted the sleepy quiet pastoral days to last always.\n",
       "Trouble between the Mormons and the Gentiles of the community would\n",
       "make her unhappy. She was Mormon-born, and she was a friend to poor\n",
       "and unfortunate Gentiles. She wished only to go on doing good and being\n",
       "happy. And she thought of what that great ranch meant to her. She loved\n",
       "it all--the grove of cottonwoods, the old stone house, the amber-tinted\n",
       "water, and the droves of shaggy, dusty horses and mustangs, the sleek,\n",
       "clean-limbed, blooded racers, and the browsing herds of cattle and the\n",
       "lean, sun-browned riders of the sage.\n",
       "\n",
       "While she waited there she forgot the prospect of untoward change. The\n",
       "bray of a lazy burro broke the afternoon quiet, and it was comfortingly\n",
       "suggestive of the drowsy farmyard, and the open corrals, and the green\n",
       "alfalfa fields. Her clear sight intensified the purple sage-slope as it\n",
       "rolled before her. Low swells of prairie-like ground sloped up to\n",
       "the west. Dark, lonely cedar-trees, few and far between, stood out\n",
       "strikingly, and at long distances ruins of red rocks. Farther on, up the\n",
       "gradual slope, rose a broken wall, a huge monument, looming dark purple\n",
       "and stretching its solitary, mystic way, a wavering line that faded\n",
       "in the north. Here to the westward was the light and color and beauty.\n",
       "Northward the slope descended to a dim line of canyons from which rose\n",
       "an up-flinging of the earth, not mountainous, but a vast heave of purple\n",
       "uplands, with ribbed and fan-shaped walls, castle-crowned cliffs, and\n",
       "gray escarpments. Over it all crept the lengthening, waning afternoon\n",
       "shadows.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rapid beat of hoofs recalled Jane Withersteen to the question at\n",
       "hand. A group of riders cantered up the lane, dismounted, and threw\n",
       "their bridles. They were seven in number, and Tull, the leader, a tall,\n",
       "dark man, was an elder of Jane's church.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Did you get my message?” he asked, curtly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes,” replied Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I sent word I'd give that rider Venters half an hour to come down to\n",
       "the village. He didn't come.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“He knows nothing of it;” said Jane. “I didn't tell him. I've been\n",
       "waiting here for you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Where is Venters?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I left him in the courtyard.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Here, Jerry,” called Tull, turning to his men, “take the gang and fetch\n",
       "Venters out here if you have to rope him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The dusty-booted and long-spurred riders clanked noisily into the grove\n",
       "of cottonwoods and disappeared in the shade.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Elder Tull, what do you mean by this?” demanded Jane. “If you must\n",
       "arrest Venters you might have the courtesy to wait till he leaves my\n",
       "home. And if you do arrest him it will be adding insult to injury. It's\n",
       "absurd to accuse Venters of being mixed up in that shooting fray in the\n",
       "village last night. He was with me at the time. Besides, he let me take\n",
       "charge of his guns. You're only using this as a pretext. What do you\n",
       "mean to do to Venters?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'll tell you presently,” replied Tull. “But first tell me why you\n",
       "defend this worthless rider?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Worthless!” exclaimed Jane, indignantly. “He's nothing of the kind.\n",
       "He was the best rider I ever had. There's not a reason why I shouldn't\n",
       "champion him and every reason why I should. It's no little shame to me,\n",
       "Elder Tull, that through my friendship he has roused the enmity of my\n",
       "people and become an outcast. Besides I owe him eternal gratitude for\n",
       "saving the life of little Fay.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I've heard of your love for Fay Larkin and that you intend to adopt\n",
       "her. But--Jane Withersteen, the child is a Gentile!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes. But, Elder, I don't love the Mormon children any less because I\n",
       "love a Gentile child. I shall adopt Fay if her mother will give her to\n",
       "me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm not so much against that. You can give the child Mormon teaching,”\n",
       " said Tull. “But I'm sick of seeing this fellow Venters hang around you.\n",
       "I'm going to put a stop to it. You've so much love to throw away on\n",
       "these beggars of Gentiles that I've an idea you might love Venters.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Tull spoke with the arrogance of a Mormon whose power could not be\n",
       "brooked and with the passion of a man in whom jealousy had kindled a\n",
       "consuming fire.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Maybe I do love him,” said Jane. She felt both fear and anger stir her\n",
       "heart. “I'd never thought of that. Poor fellow! he certainly needs some\n",
       "one to love him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“This'll be a bad day for Venters unless you deny that,” returned Tull,\n",
       "grimly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Tull's men appeared under the cottonwoods and led a young man out into\n",
       "the lane. His ragged clothes were those of an outcast. But he stood tall\n",
       "and straight, his wide shoulders flung back, with the muscles of his\n",
       "bound arms rippling and a blue flame of defiance in the gaze he bent on\n",
       "Tull.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the first time Jane Withersteen felt Venters's real spirit. She\n",
       "wondered if she would love this splendid youth. Then her emotion cooled\n",
       "to the sobering sense of the issue at stake.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Venters, will you leave Cottonwoods at once and forever?” asked Tull,\n",
       "tensely.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why?” rejoined the rider.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Because I order it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters laughed in cool disdain.\n",
       "\n",
       "The red leaped to Tull's dark cheek.\n",
       "\n",
       "“If you don't go it means your ruin,” he said, sharply.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ruin!” exclaimed Venters, passionately. “Haven't you already ruined me?\n",
       "What do you call ruin? A year ago I was a rider. I had horses and cattle\n",
       "of my own. I had a good name in Cottonwoods. And now when I come into\n",
       "the village to see this woman you set your men on me. You hound me. You\n",
       "trail me as if I were a rustler. I've no more to lose--except my life.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Will you leave Utah?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh! I know,” went on Venters, tauntingly, “it galls you, the idea of\n",
       "beautiful Jane Withersteen being friendly to a poor Gentile. You want\n",
       "her all yourself. You're a wiving Mormon. You have use for her--and\n",
       "Withersteen House and Amber Spring and seven thousand head of cattle!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Tull's hard jaw protruded, and rioting blood corded the veins of his\n",
       "neck.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Once more. Will you go?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“NO!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Then I'll have you whipped within an inch of your life,” replied Tull,\n",
       "harshly. “I'll turn you out in the sage. And if you ever come back\n",
       "you'll get worse.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters's agitated face grew coldly set and the bronze changed\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane impulsively stepped forward. “Oh! Elder Tull!” she cried. “You\n",
       "won't do that!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Tull lifted a shaking finger toward her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That'll do from you. Understand, you'll not be allowed to hold this boy\n",
       "to a friendship that's offensive to your Bishop. Jane Withersteen, your\n",
       "father left you wealth and power. It has turned your head. You haven't\n",
       "yet come to see the place of Mormon women. We've reasoned with you,\n",
       "borne with you. We've patiently waited. We've let you have your fling,\n",
       "which is more than I ever saw granted to a Mormon woman. But you haven't\n",
       "come to your senses. Now, once for all, you can't have any further\n",
       "friendship with Venters. He's going to be whipped, and he's got to leave\n",
       "Utah!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh! Don't whip him! It would be dastardly!” implored Jane, with slow\n",
       "certainty of her failing courage.\n",
       "\n",
       "Tull always blunted her spirit, and she grew conscious that she had\n",
       "feigned a boldness which she did not possess. He loomed up now in\n",
       "different guise, not as a jealous suitor, but embodying the mysterious\n",
       "despotism she had known from childhood--the power of her creed.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Venters, will you take your whipping here or would you rather go out\n",
       "in the sage?” asked Tull. He smiled a flinty smile that was more\n",
       "than inhuman, yet seemed to give out of its dark aloofness a gleam of\n",

       "But there was something more in him, barely hidden, a something personal\n",
       "and sinister, a deep of himself, an engulfing abyss. As his religious\n",

       "at hand. An answer to her prayer!\n",
       "\n",
       "“Do you know him? Does any one know him?” questioned Tull, hurriedly.\n",

       "His men looked and looked, and one by one shook their heads.\n",
       "\n",

       "With a wave of his hand, enjoining silence, Tull stepped forward in such\n",
       "a way that he concealed Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rider reined in his mount, and with a lithe forward-slipping\n",
       "action appeared to reach the ground in one long step. It was a peculiar\n",
       "movement in its quickness and inasmuch that while performing it the\n",
       "rider did not swerve in the slightest from a square front to the group\n",
       "before him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Look!” hoarsely whispered one of Tull's companions. “He packs two\n",

       "relax.\n",

       "the range rider's--the leanness, the red burn of the sun, and the set\n",
       "changelessness that came from years of silence and solitude. But it was\n",
       "not these which held her, rather the intensity of his gaze, a strained\n",
       "weariness, a piercing wistfulness of keen, gray sight, as if the man\n",
       "was forever looking for that which he never found. Jane's subtle woman's\n",
       "intuition, even in that brief instant, felt a sadness, a hungering, a\n",

       "\n",
       "The rider stepped away from her, moving out with the same slow, measured\n",
       "stride in which he had approached, and the fact that his action placed\n",
       "her wholly to one side, and him no nearer to Tull and his men, had a\n",
       "penetrating significance.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“Here stranger, this's none of your mix,” began Tull. “Don't try any\n",
       "interference. You've been asked to drink and eat. That's more than you'd\n",
       "have got in any other village of the Utah border. Water your horse and\n",
       "be on your way.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Easy--easy--I ain't interferin' yet,” replied the rider. The tone of\n",
       "his voice had undergone a change. A different man had spoken. Where, in\n",
       "addressing Jane, he had been mild and gentle, now, with his first speech\n",
       "to Tull, he was dry, cool, biting. “I've lest stumbled onto a queer\n",
       "deal. Seven Mormons all packin' guns, an' a Gentile tied with a rope,\n",
       "an' a woman who swears by his honesty! Queer, ain't that?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Queer or not, it's none of your business,” retorted Tull.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Where I was raised a woman's word was law. I ain't quite outgrowed that\n",

       "\n",
       "“To hell with your Mormon law!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The deliberate speech marked the rider's further change, this time from\n",
       "kindly interest to an awakening menace. It produced a transformation in\n",
       "Tull and his companions. The leader gasped and staggered backward at\n",
       "a blasphemous affront to an institution he held most sacred. The man\n",
       "Jerry, holding the horses, dropped the bridles and froze in his tracks.\n",
       "Like posts the other men stood watchful-eyed, arms hanging rigid, all\n",
       "waiting.\n",

       "“Speak up now, young man. What have you done to be roped that way?”\n",

       "\n",
       "“Ma'am, is it true--what he says?” asked the rider of Jane, but his\n",

       "of the horses, with Jane failing to repress her mounting agitations,\n",

       "tightened. Tull broke the spell with a laugh, a laugh without mirth, a\n",

       "sage. Here was the unknown and the perilous. The whole scene impressed\n",
       "Venters as a wild, austere, and mighty manifestation of nature. And\n",
       "as it somehow reminded him of his prospect in life, so it suddenly\n",
       "resembled the woman near him, only in her there were greater beauty and\n",

       "the peal of a hunting-horn, floated back the answer. The outgoing riders\n",
       "moved swiftly, came sharply into sight as they topped a ridge to show\n",
       "wild and black above the horizon, and then passed down, dimming into the\n",
       "purple of the sage.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I hope they don't meet Lassiter,” said Jane.\n",

       "disbelieved. At Glaze his name was known, but none of the riders or\n",
       "ranchers I knew there ever met him. At Stone Bridge I never heard him\n",
       "mentioned. But at Sterling and villages north of there he was spoken of\n",
       "often. I've never been in a village which he had been known to visit.\n",
       "There were many conflicting stories about him and his doings. Some said\n",
       "he had shot up this and that Mormon village, and others denied it. I'm\n",
       "inclined to believe he has, and you know how Mormons hide the truth. But\n",
       "there was one feature about Lassiter upon which all agree--that he was\n",
       "what riders in this country call a gun-man. He's a man with a marvelous\n",
       "quickness and accuracy in the use of a Colt. And now that I've seen him\n",
       "I know more. Lassiter was born without fear. I watched him with eyes\n",
       "which saw him my friend. I'll never forget the moment I recognized him\n",
       "from what had been told me of his crouch before the draw. It was then I\n",
       "yelled his name. I believe that yell saved Tull's life. At any rate, I\n",

       "hiding-place of Oldring and his band, and told it to my riders? That\n",
       "would disarm Tull's ugly hints and put you in favor. For years my riders\n",
       "have trailed the tracks of stolen cattle. You know as well as I how\n",
       "dearly we've paid for our ranges in this wild country. Oldring drives\n",
       "our cattle down into the network of deceiving canyons, and somewhere far\n",

       "through the bushes, down the knoll, and on under the dark trees to the\n",
       "edge of the grove. The sky was now turning from gray to blue; stars had\n",
       "begun to lighten the earlier blackness; and from the wide flat sweep\n",
       "before him blew a cool wind, fragrant with the breath of sage. Keeping\n",
       "close to the edge of the cottonwoods, he went swiftly and silently\n",
       "westward. The grove was long, and he had not reached the end when he\n",
       "heard something that brought him to a halt. Low padded thuds told\n",
       "him horses were coming this way. He sank down in the gloom, waiting,\n",
       "listening. Much before he had expected, judging from sound, to his\n",
       "amazement he descried horsemen near at hand. They were riding along the\n",
       "border of the sage, and instantly he knew the hoofs of the horses were\n",
       "muffled. Then the pale starlight afforded him indistinct sight of the\n",
       "riders. But his eyes were keen and used to the dark, and by peering\n",
       "closely he recognized the huge bulk and black-bearded visage of Oldring\n",
       "and the lithe, supple form of the rustler's lieutenant, a masked rider.\n",
       "They passed on; the darkness swallowed them. Then, farther out on the\n",
       "sage, a dark, compact body of horsemen went by, almost without sound,\n",
       "almost like specters, and they, too, melted into the night.\n",

       "No unusual circumstances was it for Oldring and some of his men to visit\n",
       "Cottonwoods in the broad light of day, but for him to prowl about in\n",
       "the dark with the hoofs of his horses muffled meant that mischief was\n",
       "brewing. Moreover, to Venters the presence of the masked rider with\n",
       "Oldring seemed especially ominous. For about this man there was mystery,\n",
       "he seldom rode through the village, and when he did ride through it\n",

       "Between the trees twinkled lights of cottage candles, and far down\n",

       "So Venters, seeing there was little for him to learn, began retracing\n",
       "his steps. The church was dark, Bishop Dyer's home next to it was also\n",
       "dark, and likewise Tull's cottage. Upon almost any night at this hour\n",
       "there would be lights here, and Venters marked the unusual omission.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he was about to pass out of the street to skirt the grove, he once\n",
       "more slunk down at the sound of trotting horses. Presently he descried\n",
       "two mounted men riding toward him. He hugged the shadow of a tree. Again\n",
       "the starlight, brighter now, aided him, and he made out Tull's stalwart\n",
       "figure, and beside him the short, froglike shape of the rider Jerry.\n",
       "They were silent, and they rode on to disappear.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters went his way with busy, gloomy mind, revolving events of\n",
       "the day, trying to reckon those brooding in the night. His thoughts\n",
       "overwhelmed him. Up in that dark grove dwelt a woman who had been his\n",
       "friend. And he skulked about her home, gripping a gun stealthily as an\n",
       "Indian, a man without place or people or purpose. Above her hovered the\n",
       "shadow of grim, hidden, secret power. No queen could have given more\n",
       "royally out of a bounteous store than Jane Withersteen gave her people,\n",
       "and likewise to those unfortunates whom her people hated. She asked only\n",
       "the divine right of all women--freedom; to love and to live as her heart\n",
       "willed. And yet prayer and her hope were vain.\n",
       "\n",
       "“For years I've seen a storm clouding over her and the village of\n",
       "Cottonwoods,” muttered Venters, as he strode on. “Soon it'll burst. I\n",
       "don't like the prospects.” That night the villagers whispered in the\n",
       "street--and night-riding rustlers muffled horses--and Tull was at work\n",
       "in secret--and out there in the sage hid a man who meant something\n",
       "terrible--Lassiter!\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters passed the black cottonwoods, and, entering the sage, climbed\n",
       "the gradual slope. He kept his direction in line with a western star.\n",
       "From time to time he stopped to listen and heard only the usual familiar\n",
       "bark of coyote and sweep of wind and rustle of sage. Presently a low\n",
       "jumble of rocks loomed up darkly somewhat to his right, and, turning\n",
       "that way, he whistled softly. Out of the rocks glided a dog that leaped\n",
       "and whined about him. He climbed over rough, broken rock, picking his\n",
       "way carefully, and then went down. Here it was darker, and sheltered\n",
       "from the wind. A white object guided him. It was another dog, and this\n",
       "one was asleep, curled up between a saddle and a pack. The animal\n",
       "awoke and thumped his tail in greeting. Venters placed the saddle for a\n",
       "pillow, rolled in his blankets, with his face upward to the stars. The\n",
       "white dog snuggled close to him. The other whined and pattered a few\n",
       "yards to the rise of ground and there crouched on guard. And in that\n",
       "wild covert Venters shut his eyes under the great white stars and\n",
       "intense vaulted blue, bitterly comparing their loneliness to his own,\n",
       "and fell asleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "When he awoke, day had dawned and all about him was bright steel-gray.\n",
       "The air had a cold tang. Arising, he greeted the fawning dogs and\n",
       "stretched his cramped body, and then, gathering together bunches of dead\n",
       "sage sticks, he lighted a fire. Strips of dried beef held to the blaze\n",
       "for a moment served him and the dogs. He drank from a canteen. There was\n",
       "nothing else in his outfit; he had grown used to a scant fire. Then he\n",
       "sat over the fire, palms outspread, and waited. Waiting had been his\n",
       "chief occupation for months, and he scarcely knew what he waited for\n",
       "unless it was the passing of the hours. But now he sensed action in the\n",
       "immediate present; the day promised another meeting with Lassiter and\n",
       "Jane, perhaps news of the rustlers; on the morrow he meant to take the\n",
       "trail to Deception Pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "And while he waited he talked to his dogs. He called them Ring and\n",
       "Whitie; they were sheep-dogs, half collie, half deerhound, superb in\n",
       "build, perfectly trained. It seemed that in his fallen fortunes these\n",
       "dogs understood the nature of their value to him, and governed their\n",
       "affection and faithfulness accordingly. Whitie watched him with somber\n",
       "eyes of love, and Ring, crouched on the little rise of ground above,\n",
       "kept tireless guard. When the sun rose, the white dog took the place of\n",
       "the other, and Ring went to sleep at his master's feet.\n",
       "\n",
       "By and by Venters rolled up his blankets and tied them and his meager\n",
       "pack together, then climbed out to look for his horse. He saw him,\n",
       "presently, a little way off in the sage, and went to fetch him. In that\n",
       "country, where every rider boasted of a fine mount and was eager for a\n",
       "race, where thoroughbreds dotted the wonderful grazing ranges, Venters\n",
       "rode a horse that was sad proof of his misfortunes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, with his back against a stone, Venters faced the east, and, stick\n",
       "in hand and idle blade, he waited. The glorious sunlight filled the\n",
       "valley with purple fire. Before him, to left, to right, waving, rolling,\n",
       "sinking, rising, like low swells of a purple sea, stretched the sage.\n",
       "Out of the grove of cottonwoods, a green patch on the purple, gleamed\n",
       "the dull red of Jane Withersteen's old stone house. And from there\n",
       "extended the wide green of the village gardens and orchards marked by\n",
       "the graceful poplars; and farther down shone the deep, dark richness of\n",
       "the alfalfa fields. Numberless red and black and white dots speckled the\n",
       "sage, and these were cattle and horses.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, watching and waiting, Venters let the time wear away. At length he\n",
       "saw a horse rise above a ridge, and he knew it to be Lassiter's\n",
       "black. Climbing to the highest rock, so that he would show against the\n",
       "sky-line, he stood and waved his hat. The almost instant turning of\n",
       "Lassiter's horse attested to the quickness of that rider's eye. Then\n",
       "Venters climbed down, saddled his horse, tied on his pack, and, with\n",
       "a word to his dogs, was about to ride out to meet Lassiter, when he\n",
       "concluded to wait for him there, on higher ground, where the outlook was\n",
       "commanding.\n",
       "\n",
       "It had been long since Venters had experienced friendly greeting from\n",
       "a man. Lassiter's warmed in him something that had grown cold from\n",
       "neglect. And when he had returned it, with a strong grip of the iron\n",
       "hand that held his, and met the gray eyes, he knew that Lassiter and he\n",
       "were to be friends.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Venters, let's talk awhile before we go down there,” said Lassiter,\n",
       "slipping his bridle. “I ain't in no hurry. Them's sure fine dogs you've\n",
       "got.” With a rider's eye he took in the points of Venter's horse, but\n",
       "did not speak his thought. “Well, did anythin' come off after I left you\n",
       "last night?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters told him about the rustlers.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I was snug hid in the sage,” replied Lassiter, “an' didn't see or hear\n",
       "no one. Oldrin's got a high hand here, I reckon. It's no news up in\n",
       "Utah how he holes in canyons an' leaves no track.” Lassiter was silent a\n",
       "moment. “Me an' Oldrin' wasn't exactly strangers some years back when he\n",
       "drove cattle into Bostil's Ford, at the head of the Rio Virgin. But he\n",
       "got harassed there an' now he drives some place else.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, you knew him? Tell me, is he Mormon or Gentile?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I can't say. I've knowed Mormons who pretended to be Gentiles.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No Mormon ever pretended that unless he was a rustler,” declared\n",
       "Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Mebbe so.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's a hard country for any one, but hardest for Gentiles. Did you ever\n",
       "know or hear of a Gentile prospering in a Mormon community?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I never did.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, I want to get out of Utah. I've a mother living in Illinois. I\n",
       "want to go home. It's eight years now.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The older man's sympathy moved Venters to tell his story. He had left\n",
       "Quincy, run off to seek his fortune in the gold fields had never gotten\n",
       "any farther than Salt Lake City, wandered here and there as helper,\n",
       "teamster, shepherd, and drifted southward over the divide and across the\n",
       "barrens and up the rugged plateau through the passes to the last border\n",
       "settlements. Here he became a rider of the sage, had stock of his own,\n",
       "and for a time prospered, until chance threw him in the employ of Jane\n",
       "Withersteen.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, I needn't tell you the rest.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, it'd be no news to me. I know Mormons. I've seen their women's\n",
       "strange love en' patience en' sacrifice an' silence en' whet I call\n",
       "madness for their idea of God. An' over against that I've seen the\n",
       "tricks of men. They work hand in hand, all together, an' in the dark.\n",
       "No man can hold out against them, unless he takes to packin' guns. For\n",
       "Mormons are slow to kill. That's the only good I ever seen in their\n",
       "religion. Venters, take this from me, these Mormons ain't just right in\n",
       "their minds. Else could a Mormon marry one woman when he already has a\n",
       "wife, an' call it duty?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, you think as I think,” returned Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“How'd it come then that you never throwed a gun on Tull or some of\n",
       "them?” inquired the rider, curiously.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane pleaded with me, begged me to be patient, to overlook. She even\n",
       "took my guns from me. I lost all before I knew it,” replied Venters,\n",
       "with the red color in his face. “But, Lassiter, listen. Out of the\n",
       "wreck I saved a Winchester, two Colts, and plenty of shells. I packed\n",
       "these down into Deception Pass. There, almost every day for six months,\n",
       "I have practiced with my rifle till the barrel burnt my hands. Practised\n",
       "the draw--the firing of a Colt, hour after hour!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Now that's interestin' to me,” said Lassiter, with a quick uplift of\n",
       "his head and a concentration of his gray gaze on Venters. “Could you\n",
       "throw a gun before you began that practisin'?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes. And now...” Venters made a lightning-swift movement.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter smiled, and then his bronzed eyelids narrowed till his eyes\n",
       "seemed mere gray slits. “You'll kill Tull!” He did not question; he\n",
       "affirmed.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I promised Jane Withersteen I'd try to avoid Tull. I'll keep my word.\n",
       "But sooner or later Tull and I will meet. As I feel now, if he even\n",
       "looks at me I'll draw!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon so. There'll be hell down there, presently.” He paused a\n",
       "moment and flicked a sage-brush with his quirt. “Venters, seein' as\n",
       "you're considerable worked up, tell me Milly Erne's story.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters's agitation stilled to the trace of suppressed eagerness in\n",
       "Lassiter's query.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Milly Erne's story? Well, Lassiter, I'll tell you what I know. Milly\n",
       "Erne had been in Cottonwoods years when I first arrived there, and most\n",
       "of what I tell you happened before my arrival. I got to know her pretty\n",
       "well. She was a slip of a woman, and crazy on religion. I conceived an\n",
       "idea that I never mentioned--I thought she was at heart more Gentile\n",
       "than Mormon. But she passed as a Mormon, and certainly she had the\n",
       "Mormon woman's locked lips. You know, in every Mormon village there are\n",
       "women who seem mysterious to us, but about Milly there was more than\n",
       "the ordinary mystery. When she came to Cottonwoods she had a beautiful\n",
       "little girl whom she loved passionately. Milly was not known openly in\n",
       "Cottonwoods as a Mormon wife. That she really was a Mormon wife I have\n",
       "no doubt. Perhaps the Mormon's other wife or wives would not acknowledge\n",
       "Milly. Such things happen in these villages. Mormon wives wear\n",
       "yokes, but they get jealous. Well, whatever had brought Milly to this\n",
       "country--love or madness of religion--she repented of it. She gave up\n",
       "teaching the village school. She quit the church. And she began to\n",
       "fight Mormon upbringing for her baby girl. Then the Mormons put on the\n",
       "screws--slowly, as is their way. At last the child disappeared. 'Lost'\n",
       "was the report. The child was stolen, I know that. So do you. That\n",
       "wrecked Milly Erne. But she lived on in hope. She became a slave. She\n",
       "worked her heart and soul and life out to get back her child. She never\n",
       "heard of it again. Then she sank.... I can see her now, a frail thing, so\n",
       "transparent you could almost look through her--white like ashes--and her\n",
       "eyes!... Her eyes have always haunted me. She had one real friend--Jane\n",
       "Withersteen. But Jane couldn't mend a broken heart, and Milly died.”\n",
       "\n",
       "For moments Lassiter did not speak, or turn his head.\n",
       "\n",
       "“The man!” he exclaimed, presently, in husky accents.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I haven't the slightest idea who the Mormon was,” replied Venters; “nor\n",
       "has any Gentile in Cottonwoods.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Does Jane Withersteen know?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes. But a red-hot running-iron couldn't burn that name out of her!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Without further speech Lassiter started off, walking his horse and\n",
       "Venters followed with his dogs. Half a mile down the slope they entered\n",
       "a luxuriant growth of willows, and soon came into an open space carpeted\n",
       "with grass like deep green velvet. The rushing of water and singing of\n",
       "birds filled their ears. Venters led his comrade to a shady bower and\n",
       "showed him Amber Spring. It was a magnificent outburst of clear, amber\n",
       "water pouring from a dark, stone-lined hole. Lassiter knelt and drank,\n",
       "lingered there to drink again. He made no comment, but Venters did not\n",
       "need words. Next to his horse a rider of the sage loved a spring. And\n",
       "this spring was the most beautiful and remarkable known to the upland\n",
       "riders of southern Utah. It was the spring that made old Withersteen a\n",
       "feudal lord and now enabled his daughter to return the toll which her\n",
       "father had exacted from the toilers of the sage.\n",
       "\n",
       "The spring gushed forth in a swirling torrent, and leaped down joyously\n",
       "to make its swift way along a willow-skirted channel. Moss and ferns and\n",
       "lilies overhung its green banks. Except for the rough-hewn stones that\n",
       "held and directed the water, this willow thicket and glade had been left\n",
       "as nature had made it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Below were artificial lakes, three in number, one above the other\n",
       "in banks of raised earth, and round about them rose the lofty\n",
       "green-foliaged shafts of poplar trees. Ducks dotted the glassy surface\n",
       "of the lakes; a blue heron stood motionless on a water-gate; kingfishers\n",
       "darted with shrieking flight along the shady banks; a white hawk\n",
       "sailed above; and from the trees and shrubs came the song of robins\n",
       "and cat-birds. It was all in strange contrast to the endless slopes of\n",
       "lonely sage and the wild rock environs beyond. Venters thought of the\n",
       "woman who loved the birds and the green of the leaves and the murmur of\n",
       "the water.\n",
       "\n",
       "Next on the slope, just below the third and largest lake, were corrals\n",
       "and a wide stone barn and open sheds and coops and pens. Here were\n",
       "clouds of dust, and cracking sounds of hoofs, and romping colts and\n",
       "heehawing burros. Neighing horses trampled to the corral fences. And\n",
       "on the little windows of the barn projected bobbing heads of bays and\n",
       "blacks and sorrels. When the two men entered the immense barnyard, from\n",
       "all around the din increased. This welcome, however, was not seconded by\n",
       "the several men and boys who vanished on sight.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters and Lassiter were turning toward the house when Jane appeared in\n",
       "the lane leading a horse. In riding-skirt and blouse she seemed to have\n",
       "lost some of her statuesque proportions, and looked more like a girl\n",
       "rider than the mistress of Withersteen. She was brightly smiling, and\n",
       "her greeting was warmly cordial.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Good news,” she announced. “I've been to the village. All is quiet.\n",
       "I expected--I don't know what. But there's no excitement. And Tull has\n",
       "ridden out on his way to Glaze.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Tull gone?” inquired Venters, with surprise. He was wondering what\n",
       "could have taken Tull away. Was it to avoid another meeting with\n",
       "Lassiter that he went? Could it have any connection with the probable\n",
       "nearness of Oldring and his gang?\n",
       "\n",
       "“Gone, yes, thank goodness,” replied Jane. “Now I'll have peace for a\n",
       "while. Lassiter, I want you to see my horses. You are a rider, and\n",
       "you must be a judge of horseflesh. Some of mine have Arabian blood.\n",
       "My father got his best strain in Nevada from Indians who claimed their\n",
       "horses were bred down from the original stock left by the Spaniards.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, ma'am, the one you've been ridin' takes my eye,” said Lassiter,\n",
       "as he walked round the racy, clean-limbed, and fine-pointed roan.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Where are the boys?” she asked, looking about. “Jerd, Paul, where are\n",
       "you? Here, bring out the horses.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The sound of dropping bars inside the barn was the signal for the horses\n",
       "to jerk their heads in the windows, to snort and stamp. Then they came\n",
       "pounding out of the door, a file of thoroughbreds, to plunge about\n",
       "the barnyard, heads and tails up, manes flying. They halted afar off,\n",
       "squared away to look, came slowly forward with whinnies for their\n",
       "mistress, and doubtful snorts for the strangers and their horses.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Come--come--come,” called Jane, holding out her hands. “Why,\n",
       "Bells--Wrangle, where are your manners? Come, Black Star--come, Night.\n",
       "Ah, you beauties! My racers of the sage!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Only two came up to her; those she called Night and Black Star. Venters\n",
       "never looked at them without delight. The first was soft dead black, the\n",
       "other glittering black, and they were perfectly matched in size, both\n",
       "being high and long-bodied, wide through the shoulders, with lithe,\n",
       "powerful legs. That they were a woman's pets showed in the gloss of\n",
       "skin, the fineness of mane. It showed, too, in the light of big eyes and\n",
       "the gentle reach of eagerness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I never seen their like,” was Lassiter's encomium, “an' in my day I've\n",
       "seen a sight of horses. Now, ma'am, if you was wantin' to make a long\n",
       "an' fast ride across the sage--say to elope--”\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter ended there with dry humor, yet behind that was meaning. Jane\n",
       "blushed and made arch eyes at him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Take care, Lassiter, I might think that a proposal,” she replied,\n",
       "gaily. “It's dangerous to propose elopement to a Mormon woman. Well,\n",
       "I was expecting you. Now will be a good hour to show you Milly Erne's\n",
       "grave. The day-riders have gone, and the night-riders haven't come in.\n",
       "Bern, what do you make of that? Need I worry? You know I have to be made\n",
       "to worry.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, it's not usual for the night shift to ride in so late,” replied\n",
       "Venters, slowly, and his glance sought Lassiter's. “Cattle are usually\n",
       "quiet after dark. Still, I've known even a coyote to stampede your white\n",
       "herd.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I refuse to borrow trouble. Come,” said Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "They mounted, and, with Jane in the lead, rode down the lane, and,\n",
       "turning off into a cattle trail, proceeded westward. Venters's dogs\n",
       "trotted behind them. On this side of the ranch the outlook was different\n",
       "from that on the other; the immediate foreground was rough and the sage\n",
       "more rugged and less colorful; there were no dark-blue lines of canyons\n",
       "to hold the eye, nor any uprearing rock walls. It was a long roll and\n",
       "slope into gray obscurity. Soon Jane left the trail and rode into the\n",
       "sage, and presently she dismounted and threw her bridle. The men did\n",
       "likewise. Then, on foot, they followed her, coming out at length on the\n",
       "rim of a low escarpment. She passed by several little ridges of earth to\n",
       "halt before a faintly defined mound. It lay in the shade of a sweeping\n",
       "sage-brush close to the edge of the promontory; and a rider could have\n",
       "jumped his horse over it without recognizing a grave.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Here!”\n",
       "\n",
       "She looked sad as she spoke, but she offered no explanation for the\n",
       "neglect of an unmarked, uncared-for grave. There was a little bunch of\n",
       "pale, sweet lavender daisies, doubtless planted there by Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I only come here to remember and to pray,” she said. “But I leave no\n",
       "trail!”\n",
       "\n",
       "A grave in the sage! How lonely this resting-place of Milly Erne! The\n",
       "cottonwoods or the alfalfa fields were not in sight, nor was there any\n",
       "rock or ridge or cedar to lend contrast to the monotony. Gray slopes,\n",
       "tinging the purple, barren and wild, with the wind waving the sage,\n",
       "swept away to the dim horizon.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter looked at the grave and then out into space. At that moment he\n",
       "seemed a figure of bronze.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane touched Venters's arm and led him back to the horses.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern!” cried Jane, when they were out of hearing. “Suppose Lassiter\n",
       "were Milly's husband--the father of that little girl lost so long ago!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“It might be, Jane. Let us ride on. If he wants to see us again he'll\n",
       "come.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So they mounted and rode out to the cattle trail and began to climb.\n",
       "From the height of the ridge, where they had started down, Venters\n",
       "looked back. He did not see Lassiter, but his glance, drawn irresistibly\n",
       "farther out on the gradual slope, caught sight of a moving cloud of\n",
       "dust.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hello, a rider!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes, I see,” said Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That fellow's riding hard. Jane, there's something wrong.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh yes, there must be.... How he rides!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The horse disappeared in the sage, and then puffs of dust marked his\n",
       "course.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He's short-cut on us--he's making straight for the corrals.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters and Jane galloped their steeds and reined in at the turning of\n",
       "the lane. This lane led down to the right of the grove. Suddenly into\n",
       "its lower entrance flashed a bay horse. Then Venters caught the fast\n",
       "rhythmic beat of pounding hoofs. Soon his keen eye recognized the swing\n",
       "of the rider in his saddle.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's Judkins, your Gentile rider!” he cried. “Jane, when Judkins rides\n",

       "\n",
       "“Judkins, you're all bloody!” cried Jane, in affright. “Oh, you've been\n",

       "\n",
       "Venters rode to the barn, and, leaping off, shouted for Jerd. The boy\n",
       "came running. Venters sent him for meat, bread, and dried fruits, to\n",
       "be packed in saddlebags. His own horse he turned loose into the nearest\n",
       "corral. Then he went for Wrangle. The giant sorrel had earned his name\n",
       "for a trait the opposite of amiability. He came readily out of the barn,\n",
       "but once in the yard he broke from Venters, and plunged about with ears\n",
       "laid back. Venters had to rope him, and then he kicked down a section\n",

       "\n",
       "When Venters's boot touched the stirrup the sorrel bolted, giving him\n",
       "the rider's flying mount. The swing of this fiery horse recalled to\n",
       "Venters days that were not really long past, when he rode into the sage\n",
       "as the leader of Jane Withersteen's riders. Wrangle pulled hard on a\n",
       "tight rein. He galloped out of the lane, down the shady border of\n",
       "the grove, and hauled up at the watering-trough, where he pranced and\n",
       "champed his bit. Venters got off and filled his canteen while the horse\n",
       "drank. The dogs, Ring and Whitie, came trotting up for their drink. Then\n",
       "Venters remounted and turned Wrangle toward the sage.\n",
       "\n",
       "A wide, white trail wound away down the slope. One keen, sweeping glance\n",
       "told Venters that there was neither man nor horse nor steer within the\n",
       "limit of his vision, unless they were lying down in the sage. Ring loped\n",
       "in the lead and Whitie loped in the rear. Wrangle settled gradually into\n",
       "an easy swinging canter, and Venters's thoughts, now that the rush and\n",
       "flurry of the start were past, and the long miles stretched before him,\n",
       "reverted to a calm reckoning of late singular coincidences.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was the night ride of Tull's, which, viewed in the light of\n",
       "subsequent events, had a look of his covert machinations; Oldring and\n",
       "his Masked Rider and his rustlers riding muffled horses; the report\n",
       "that Tull had ridden out that morning with his man Jerry on the trail\n",
       "to Glaze, the strange disappearance of Jane Withersteen's riders,\n",
       "the unusually determined attempt to kill the one Gentile still in her\n",
       "employ, an intention frustrated, no doubt, only by Judkin's magnificent\n",
       "riding of her racer, and lastly the driving of the red herd. These\n",
       "events, to Venters's color of mind, had a dark relationship. Remembering\n",
       "Jane's accusation of bitterness, he tried hard to put aside his rancor\n",
       "in judging Tull. But it was bitter knowledge that made him see the\n",
       "truth. He had felt the shadow of an unseen hand; he had watched till he\n",
       "saw its dim outline, and then he had traced it to a man's hate, to\n",
       "the rivalry of a Mormon Elder, to the power of a Bishop, to the long,\n",
       "far-reaching arm of a terrible creed. That unseen hand had made its\n",
       "first move against Jane Withersteen. Her riders had been called in,\n",
       "leaving her without help to drive seven thousand head of cattle. But to\n",
       "Venters it seemed extraordinary that the power which had called in these\n",
       "riders had left so many cattle to be driven by rustlers and harried by\n",
       "wolves. For hand in glove with that power was an insatiate greed; they\n",
       "were one and the same.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What can Oldring do with twenty-five hundred head of cattle?” muttered\n",
       "Venters. “Is he a Mormon? Did he meet Tull last night? It looks like\n",
       "a black plot to me. But Tull and his churchmen wouldn't ruin Jane\n",
       "Withersteen unless the Church was to profit by that ruin. Where does\n",
       "Oldring come in? I'm going to find out about these things.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Wrangle did the twenty-five miles in three hours and walked little of\n",
       "the way. When he had gotten warmed up he had been allowed to choose his\n",
       "own gait. The afternoon had well advanced when Venters struck the trail\n",
       "of the red herd and found where it had grazed the night before. Then\n",
       "Venters rested the horse and used his eyes. Near at hand were a cow\n",
       "and a calf and several yearlings, and farther out in the sage some\n",
       "straggling steers. He caught a glimpse of coyotes skulking near the\n",
       "cattle. The slow sweeping gaze of the rider failed to find other living\n",
       "things within the field of sight. The sage about him was breast-high to\n",
       "his horse, oversweet with its warm, fragrant breath, gray where it\n",
       "waved to the light, darker where the wind left it still, and beyond the\n",
       "wonderful haze-purple lent by distance. Far across that wide waste began\n",
       "the slow lift of uplands through which Deception Pass cut its tortuous\n",
       "many-canyoned way.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters raised the bridle of his horse and followed the broad cattle\n",
       "trail. The crushed sage resembled the path of a monster snake. In a few\n",
       "miles of travel he passed several cows and calves that had escaped the\n",
       "drive. Then he stood on the last high bench of the slope with the floor\n",
       "of the valley beneath. The opening of the canyon showed in a break of\n",
       "the sage, and the cattle trail paralleled it as far as he could see.\n",
       "That trail led to an undiscovered point where Oldring drove cattle\n",
       "into the pass, and many a rider who had followed it had never returned.\n",
       "Venters satisfied himself that the rustlers had not deviated from their\n",
       "usual course, and then he turned at right angles off the cattle trail\n",
       "and made for the head of the pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sun lost its heat and wore down to the western horizon, where it\n",
       "changed from white to gold and rested like a huge ball about to roll on\n",
       "its golden shadows down the slope. Venters watched the lengthening of\n",
       "the rays and bars, and marveled at his own league-long shadow. The sun\n",
       "sank. There was instant shading of brightness about him, and he saw a\n",
       "kind of cold purple bloom creep ahead of him to cross the canyon, to\n",
       "mount the opposite slope and chase and darken and bury the last golden\n",
       "flare of sunlight.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters rode into a trail that he always took to get down into the\n",
       "canyon. He dismounted and found no tracks but his own made days\n",
       "previous. Nevertheless he sent the dog Ring ahead and waited. In a\n",
       "little while Ring returned. Whereupon Venters led his horse on to the\n",
       "break in the ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "The opening into Deception Pass was one of the remarkable natural\n",
       "phenomena in a country remarkable for vast slopes of sage, uplands\n",
       "insulated by gigantic red walls, and deep canyons of mysterious source\n",
       "and outlet. Here the valley floor was level, and here opened a narrow\n",
       "chasm, a ragged vent in yellow walls of stone. The trail down the five\n",
       "hundred feet of sheer depth always tested Venters's nerve. It was\n",
       "bad going for even a burro. But Wrangle, as Venters led him, snorted\n",
       "defiance or disgust rather than fear, and, like a hobbled horse on the\n",
       "jump, lifted his ponderous iron-shod fore hoofs and crashed down over\n",
       "the first rough step. Venters warmed to greater admiration of the\n",
       "sorrel; and, giving him a loose bridle, he stepped down foot by foot.\n",
       "Oftentimes the stones and shale started by Wrangle buried Venters to\n",
       "his knees; again he was hard put to it to dodge a rolling boulder, there\n",
       "were times when he could not see Wrangle for dust, and once he and the\n",
       "horse rode a sliding shelf of yellow, weathered cliff. It was a trail\n",
       "on which there could be no stops, and, therefore, if perilous, it was at\n",
       "least one that did not take long in the descent.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters breathed lighter when that was over, and felt a sudden assurance\n",
       "in the success of his enterprise. For at first it had been a reckless\n",
       "determination to achieve something at any cost, and now it resolved\n",
       "itself into an adventure worthy of all his reason and cunning, and\n",
       "keenness of eye and ear.\n",
       "\n",
       "Pinyon pines clustered in little clumps along the level floor of the\n",
       "pass. Twilight had gathered under the walls. Venters rode into the trail\n",
       "and up the canyon. Gradually the trees and caves and objects low down\n",
       "turned black, and this blackness moved up the walls till night enfolded\n",
       "the pass, while day still lingered above. The sky darkened; and stars\n",
       "began to show, at first pale and then bright. Sharp notches of the\n",
       "rim-wall, biting like teeth into the blue, were landmarks by which\n",
       "Venters knew where his camping site lay. He had to feel his way through\n",
       "a thicket of slender oaks to a spring where he watered Wrangle and drank\n",
       "himself. Here he unsaddled and turned Wrangle loose, having no fear that\n",
       "the horse would leave the thick, cool grass adjacent to the spring. Next\n",
       "he satisfied his own hunger, fed Ring and Whitie and, with them curled\n",
       "beside him, composed himself to await sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "There had been a time when night in the high altitude of these Utah\n",
       "uplands had been satisfying to Venters. But that was before the\n",
       "oppression of enemies had made the change in his mind. As a rider\n",
       "guarding the herd he had never thought of the night's wildness and\n",
       "loneliness; as an outcast, now when the full silence set in, and the\n",
       "deep darkness, and trains of radiant stars shone cold and calm, he\n",
       "lay with an ache in his heart. For a year he had lived as a black fox,\n",
       "driven from his kind. He longed for the sound of a voice, the touch of\n",
       "a hand. In the daytime there was riding from place to place, and the\n",
       "gun practice to which something drove him, and other tasks that at least\n",
       "necessitated action, at night, before he won sleep, there was strife in\n",
       "his soul. He yearned to leave the endless sage slopes, the wilderness\n",
       "of canyons, and it was in the lonely night that this yearning grew\n",
       "unbearable. It was then that he reached forth to feel Ring or Whitie,\n",
       "immeasurably grateful for the love and companionship of two dogs.\n",
       "\n",
       "On this night the same old loneliness beset Venters, the old habit\n",
       "of sad thought and burning unquiet had its way. But from it evolved a\n",
       "conviction that his useless life had undergone a subtle change. He had\n",
       "sensed it first when Wrangle swung him up to the high saddle, he knew\n",
       "it now when he lay in the gateway of Deception Pass. He had no thrill of\n",
       "adventure, rather a gloomy perception of great hazard, perhaps death. He\n",
       "meant to find Oldring's retreat. The rustlers had fast horses, but none\n",
       "that could catch Wrangle. Venters knew no rustler could creep upon him\n",
       "at night when Ring and Whitie guarded his hiding-place. For the rest, he\n",
       "had eyes and ears, and a long rifle and an unerring aim, which he meant\n",
       "to use. Strangely his foreshadowing of change did not hold a thought\n",
       "of the killing of Tull. It related only to what was to happen to him in\n",
       "Deception Pass; and he could no more lift the veil of that mystery than\n",
       "tell where the trails led to in that unexplored canyon. Moreover, he did\n",
       "not care. And at length, tired out by stress of thought, he fell asleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "When his eyes unclosed, day had come again, and he saw the rim of the\n",
       "opposite wall tipped with the gold of sunrise. A few moments sufficed\n",
       "for the morning's simple camp duties. Near at hand he found Wrangle,\n",
       "and to his surprise the horse came to him. Wrangle was one of the horses\n",
       "that left his viciousness in the home corral. What he wanted was to be\n",
       "free of mules and burros and steers, to roll in dust-patches, and then\n",
       "to run down the wide, open, windy sage-plains, and at night browse and\n",
       "sleep in the cool wet grass of a springhole. Jerd knew the sorrel when\n",
       "he said of him, “Wait till he smells the sage!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters saddled and led him out of the oak thicket, and, leaping\n",
       "astride, rode up the canyon, with Ring and Whitie trotting behind. An\n",
       "old grass-grown trail followed the course of a shallow wash where flowed\n",
       "a thin stream of water. The canyon was a hundred rods wide, its yellow\n",
       "walls were perpendicular; it had abundant sage and a scant growth of oak\n",
       "and pinon. For five miles it held to a comparatively straight bearing,\n",
       "and then began a heightening of rugged walls and a deepening of the\n",

       "canyon Venters had never explored, and here was the real door to the\n",
       "intricacies of Deception Pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "He reined Wrangle to a walk, halted now and then to listen, and then\n",
       "proceeded cautiously with shifting and alert gaze. The canyon assumed\n",
       "proportions that dwarfed those of its first ten miles. Venters rode on\n",
       "and on, not losing in the interest of his wide surroundings any of his\n",
       "caution or keen search for tracks or sight of living thing. If there\n",
       "ever had been a trail here, he could not find it. He rode through sage\n",
       "and clumps of pinon trees and grassy plots where long-petaled purple\n",
       "lilies bloomed. He rode through a dark constriction of the pass no wider\n",
       "than the lane in the grove at Cottonwoods. And he came out into a great\n",
       "amphitheater into which jutted huge towering corners of a confluence of\n",
       "intersecting canyons.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters sat his horse, and, with a rider's eye, studied this wild\n",
       "cross-cut of huge stone gullies. Then he went on, guided by the course\n",
       "of running water. If it had not been for the main stream of water\n",
       "flowing north he would never have been able to tell which of those many\n",
       "openings was a continuation of the pass. In crossing this amphitheater\n",
       "he went by the mouths of five canyons, fording little streams that\n",
       "flowed into the larger one. Gaining the outlet which he took to be the\n",
       "pass, he rode on again under over hanging walls. One side was dark in\n",
       "shade, the other light in sun. This narrow passageway turned and twisted\n",
       "and opened into a valley that amazed Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here again was a sweep of purple sage, richer than upon the higher\n",
       "levels. The valley was miles long, several wide, and inclosed by\n",
       "unscalable walls. But it was the background of this valley that so\n",
       "forcibly struck him. Across the sage-flat rose a strange up-flinging of\n",
       "yellow rocks. He could not tell which were close and which were distant.\n",
       "Scrawled mounds of stone, like mountain waves, seemed to roll up to\n",
       "steep bare slopes and towers.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this plain of sage Venters flushed birds and rabbits, and when he had\n",
       "proceeded about a mile he caught sight of the bobbing white tails of\n",
       "a herd of running antelope. He rode along the edge of the stream which\n",
       "wound toward the western end of the slowly looming mounds of stone.\n",
       "The high slope retreated out of sight behind the nearer protection.\n",
       "To Venters the valley appeared to have been filled in by a mountain of\n",
       "melted stone that had hardened in strange shapes of rounded outline.\n",
       "He followed the stream till he lost it in a deep cut. Therefore Venters\n",
       "quit the dark slit which baffled further search in that direction, and\n",
       "rode out along the curved edge of stone where it met the sage. It was\n",
       "not long before he came to a low place, and here Wrangle readily climbed\n",
       "up.\n",
       "\n",
       "All about him was ridgy roll of wind-smoothed, rain-washed rock. Not a\n",
       "tuft of grass or a bunch of sage colored the dull rust-yellow. He saw\n",
       "where, to the right, this uneven flow of stone ended in a blunt wall.\n",
       "Leftward, from the hollow that lay at his feet, mounted a gradual\n",
       "slow-swelling slope to a great height topped by leaning, cracked,\n",
       "and ruined crags. Not for some time did he grasp the wonder of that\n",
       "acclivity. It was no less than a mountain-side, glistening in the sun\n",
       "like polished granite, with cedar-trees springing as if by magic out of\n",
       "the denuded surface. Winds had swept it clear of weathered shale, and\n",
       "rains had washed it free of dust. Far up the curved slope its beautiful\n",
       "lines broke to meet the vertical rim-wall, to lose its grace in a\n",
       "different order and color of rock, a stained yellow cliff of cracks and\n",
       "caves and seamed crags. And straight before Venters was a scene less\n",
       "striking but more significant to his keen survey. For beyond a mile\n",
       "of the bare, hummocky rock began the valley of sage, and the mouths of\n",
       "canyons, one of which surely was another gateway into the pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "He got off his horse, and, giving the bridle to Ring to hold, he\n",
       "commenced a search for the cleft where the stream ran. He was not\n",
       "successful and concluded the water dropped into an underground passage.\n",
       "Then he returned to where he had left Wrangle, and led him down off the\n",
       "stone to the sage. It was a short ride to the opening canyons. There was\n",
       "no reason for a choice of which one to enter. The one he rode into was a\n",
       "clear, sharp shaft in yellow stone a thousand feet deep, with wonderful\n",
       "wind-worn caves low down and high above buttressed and turreted\n",
       "ramparts. Farther on Venters came into a region where deep indentations\n",
       "marked the line of canyon walls. These were huge, cove-like blind\n",
       "pockets extending back to a sharp corner with a dense growth of\n",
       "underbrush and trees.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters penetrated into one of these offshoots, and, as he had hoped, he\n",
       "found abundant grass. He had to bend the oak saplings to get his horse\n",
       "through. Deciding to make this a hiding-place if he could find water, he\n",
       "worked back to the limit of the shelving walls. In a little cluster of\n",
       "silver spruces he found a spring. This inclosed nook seemed an ideal\n",
       "place to leave his horse and to camp at night, and from which to make\n",
       "stealthy trips on foot. The thick grass hid his trail; the dense growth\n",
       "of oaks in the opening would serve as a barrier to keep Wrangle in, if,\n",
       "indeed, the luxuriant browse would not suffice for that. So Venters,\n",
       "leaving Whitie with the horse, called Ring to his side, and, rifle in\n",
       "hand, worked his way out to the open. A careful photographing in mind\n",
       "of the formation of the bold outlines of rimrock assured him he would be\n",
       "able to return to his retreat even in the dark.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bunches of scattered sage covered the center of the canyon, and among\n",
       "these Venters threaded his way with the step of an Indian. At intervals\n",
       "he put his hand on the dog and stopped to listen. There was a drowsy\n",
       "hum of insects, but no other sound disturbed the warm midday stillness.\n",
       "Venters saw ahead a turn, more abrupt than any yet. Warily he rounded\n",
       "this corner, once again to halt bewildered.\n",
       "\n",
       "The canyon opened fan-shaped into a great oval of green and gray\n",
       "growths. It was the hub of an oblong wheel, and from it, at regular\n",
       "distances, like spokes, ran the outgoing canyons. Here a dull red color\n",
       "predominated over the fading yellow. The corners of wall bluntly rose,\n",
       "scarred and scrawled, to taper into towers and serrated peaks and\n",
       "pinnacled domes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters pushed on more heedfully than ever. Toward the center of this\n",
       "circle the sage-brush grew smaller and farther apart He was about to\n",
       "sheer off to the right, where thickets and jumbles of fallen rock would\n",
       "afford him cover, when he ran right upon a broad cattle trail. Like a\n",
       "road it was, more than a trail, and the cattle tracks were fresh. What\n",
       "surprised him more, they were wet! He pondered over this feature. It\n",
       "had not rained. The only solution to this puzzle was that the cattle had\n",
       "been driven through water, and water deep enough to wet their legs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Suddenly Ring growled low. Venters rose cautiously and looked over the\n",
       "sage. A band of straggling horsemen were riding across the oval. He\n",
       "sank down, startled and trembling. “Rustlers!” he muttered. Hurriedly\n",
       "he glanced about for a place to hide. Near at hand there was\n",
       "nothing but sage-brush. He dared not risk crossing the open\n",
       "patches to reach the rocks. Again he peeped over the sage. The\n",
       "rustlers--four--five--seven--eight in all, were approaching, but not\n",
       "directly in line with him. That was relief for a cold deadness which\n",
       "seemed to be creeping inward along his veins. He crouched down with\n",
       "bated breath and held the bristling dog.\n",
       "\n",
       "He heard the click of iron-shod hoofs on stone, the coarse laughter of\n",
       "men, and then voices gradually dying away. Long moments passed. Then he\n",
       "rose. The rustlers were riding into a canyon. Their horses were tired,\n",
       "and they had several pack animals; evidently they had traveled far.\n",
       "Venters doubted that they were the rustlers who had driven the red herd.\n",
       "Olding's band had split. Venters watched these horsemen disappear under\n",
       "a bold canyon wall.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rustlers had come from the northwest side of the oval. Venters kept\n",
       "a steady gaze in that direction, hoping, if there were more, to see\n",
       "from what canyon they rode. A quarter of an hour went by. Reward for his\n",
       "vigilance came when he descried three more mounted men, far over to the\n",
       "north. But out of what canyon they had ridden it was too late to tell.\n",
       "He watched the three ride across the oval and round the jutting red\n",
       "corner where the others had gone.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Up that canyon!” exclaimed Venters. “Oldring's den! I've found it!”\n",
       "\n",
       "A knotty point for Venters was the fact that the cattle tracks all\n",
       "pointed west. The broad trail came from the direction of the canyon\n",
       "into which the rustlers had ridden, and undoubtedly the cattle had been\n",
       "driven out of it across the oval. There were no tracks pointing the\n",
       "other way. It had been in his mind that Oldring had driven the red herd\n",
       "toward the rendezvous, and not from it. Where did that broad trail come\n",
       "down into the pass, and where did it lead? Venters knew he wasted\n",
       "time in pondering the question, but it held a fascination not easily\n",
       "dispelled. For many years Oldring's mysterious entrance and exit to\n",
       "Deception Pass had been all-absorbing topics to sage-riders.\n",
       "\n",
       "All at once the dog put an end to Venters's pondering. Ring sniffed the\n",
       "air, turned slowly in his tracks with a whine, and then growled. Venters\n",
       "wheeled. Two horsemen were within a hundred yards, coming straight at\n",
       "him. One, lagging behind the other, was Oldring's Masked Rider.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters cunningly sank, slowly trying to merge into sage-brush. But,\n",
       "guarded as his action was, the first horse detected it. He stopped\n",
       "short, snorted, and shot up his ears. The rustler bent forward, as if\n",
       "keenly peering ahead. Then, with a swift sweep, he jerked a gun from its\n",
       "sheath and fired.\n",
       "\n",
       "The bullet zipped through the sage-brush. Flying bits of wood struck\n",
       "Venters, and the hot, stinging pain seemed to lift him in one leap.\n",
       "Like a flash the blue barrel of his rifle gleamed level and he shot\n",
       "once--twice.\n",
       "\n",
       "The foremost rustler dropped his weapon and toppled from his saddle, to\n",
       "fall with his foot catching in a stirrup. The horse snorted wildly and\n",
       "plunged away, dragging the rustler through the sage.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Masked Rider huddled over his pommel slowly swaying to one side, and\n",
       "then, with a faint, strange cry, slipped out of the saddle.\n",

       "\n",
       "Venters looked quickly from the fallen rustlers to the canyon where the\n",
       "others had disappeared. He calculated on the time needed for running\n",
       "horses to return to the open, if their riders heard shots. He waited\n",
       "breathlessly. But the estimated time dragged by and no riders appeared.\n",
       "Venters began presently to believe that the rifle reports had not\n",
       "penetrated into the recesses of the canyon, and felt safe for the\n",
       "immediate present.\n",
       "\n",
       "He hurried to the spot where the first rustler had been dragged by his\n",
       "horse. The man lay in deep grass, dead, jaw fallen, eyes protruding--a\n",
       "sight that sickened Venters. The first man at whom he had ever aimed a\n",
       "weapon he had shot through the heart. With the clammy sweat oozing\n",
       "from every pore Venters dragged the rustler in among some boulders and\n",
       "covered him with slabs of rock. Then he smoothed out the crushed trail\n",
       "in grass and sage. The rustler's horse had stopped a quarter of a mile\n",
       "off and was grazing.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Venters rapidly strode toward the Masked Rider not even the cold\n",
       "nausea that gripped him could wholly banish curiosity. For he had shot\n",
       "Oldring's infamous lieutenant, whose face had never been seen. Venters\n",
       "experienced a grim pride in the feat. What would Tull say to this\n",
       "achievement of the outcast who rode too often to Deception Pass?\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters's curious eagerness and expectation had not prepared him for the\n",
       "shock he received when he stood over a slight, dark figure. The rustler\n",
       "wore the black mask that had given him his name, but he had no weapons.\n",
       "Venters glanced at the drooping horse, there were no gun-sheaths on the\n",
       "saddle.\n",
       "\n",
       "“A rustler who didn't pack guns!” muttered Venters. “He wears no belt.\n",
       "He couldn't pack guns in that rig.... Strange!”\n",
       "\n",
       "A low, gasping intake of breath and a sudden twitching of body told\n",
       "Venters the rider still lived.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He's alive!... I've got to stand here and watch him die. And I shot an\n",
       "unarmed man.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Shrinkingly Venters removed the rider's wide sombrero and the black\n",
       "cloth mask. This action disclosed bright chestnut hair, inclined to\n",
       "curl, and a white, youthful face. Along the lower line of cheek and jaw\n",
       "was a clear demarcation, where the brown of tanned skin met the white\n",
       "that had been hidden from the sun.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, he's only a boy!... What! Can he be Oldring's Masked Rider?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The boy showed signs of returning consciousness. He stirred; his lips\n",
       "moved; a small brown hand clenched in his blouse.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters knelt with a gathering horror of his deed. His bullet had\n",
       "entered the rider's right breast, high up to the shoulder. With hands\n",
       "that shook, Venters untied a black scarf and ripped open the blood-wet\n",
       "blouse.\n",
       "\n",
       "First he saw a gaping hole, dark red against a whiteness of skin, from\n",
       "which welled a slender red stream. Then the graceful, beautiful swell of\n",
       "a woman's breast!\n",
       "\n",
       "“A woman!” he cried. “A girl!... I've killed a girl!”\n",
       "\n",
       "She suddenly opened eyes that transfixed Venters. They were fathomless\n",
       "blue. Consciousness of death was there, a blended terror and pain, but\n",
       "no consciousness of sight. She did not see Venters. She stared into the\n",
       "unknown.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then came a spasm of vitality. She writhed in a torture of reviving\n",
       "strength, and in her convulsions she almost tore from Ventner's grasp.\n",
       "Slowly she relaxed and sank partly back. The ungloved hand sought the\n",
       "wound, and pressed so hard that her wrist half buried itself in her\n",
       "bosom. Blood trickled between her spread fingers. And she looked at\n",
       "Venters with eyes that saw him.\n",
       "\n",
       "He cursed himself and the unerring aim of which he had been so proud. He\n",
       "had seen that look in the eyes of a crippled antelope which he was\n",
       "about to finish with his knife. But in her it had infinitely more--a\n",
       "revelation of mortal spirit. The instinctive bringing to life was\n",
       "there, and the divining helplessness and the terrible accusation of the\n",
       "stricken.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Forgive me! I didn't know!” burst out Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You shot me--you've killed me!” she whispered, in panting gasps. Upon\n",
       "her lips appeared a fluttering, bloody froth. By that Venters knew\n",
       "the air in her lungs was mixing with blood. “Oh, I knew--it\n",
       "would--come--some day!... Oh, the burn!... Hold me--I'm sinking--it's all\n",
       "dark.... Ah, God!... Mercy--”\n",
       "\n",
       "Her rigidity loosened in one long quiver and she lay back limp, still,\n",
       "white as snow, with closed eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters thought then that she died. But the faint pulsation of her\n",
       "breast assured him that life yet lingered. Death seemed only a matter\n",
       "of moments, for the bullet had gone clear through her. Nevertheless, he\n",
       "tore sageleaves from a bush, and, pressing them tightly over her wounds,\n",
       "he bound the black scarf round her shoulder, tying it securely under\n",
       "her arm. Then he closed the blouse, hiding from his sight that\n",
       "blood-stained, accusing breast.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What--now?” he questioned, with flying mind. “I must get out of here.\n",
       "She's dying--but I can't leave her.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He rapidly surveyed the sage to the north and made out no animate\n",
       "object. Then he picked up the girl's sombrero and the mask. This time\n",
       "the mask gave him as great a shock as when he first removed it from\n",
       "her face. For in the woman he had forgotten the rustler, and this black\n",
       "strip of felt-cloth established the identity of Oldring's Masked Rider.\n",
       "Venters had solved the mystery. He slipped his rifle under her, and,\n",
       "lifting her carefully upon it, he began to retrace his steps. The\n",
       "dog trailed in his shadow. And the horse, that had stood drooping by,\n",
       "followed without a call. Venters chose the deepest tufts of grass and\n",
       "clumps of sage on his return. From time to time he glanced over his\n",
       "shoulder. He did not rest. His concern was to avoid jarring the girl and\n",
       "to hide his trail. Gaining the narrow canyon, he turned and held close\n",
       "to the wall till he reached his hiding-place. When he entered the dense\n",
       "thicket of oaks he was hard put to it to force a way through. But he\n",
       "held his burden almost upright, and by slipping side wise and bending\n",
       "the saplings he got in. Through sage and grass he hurried to the grove\n",
       "of silver spruces.\n",
       "\n",
       "He laid the girl down, almost fearing to look at her. Though marble pale\n",
       "and cold, she was living. Venters then appreciated the tax that long\n",
       "carry had been to his strength. He sat down to rest. Whitie sniffed at\n",
       "the pale girl and whined and crept to Venters's feet. Ring lapped the\n",
       "water in the runway of the spring.\n",
       "\n",
       "Presently Venters went out to the opening, caught the horse and, leading\n",
       "him through the thicket, unsaddled him and tied him with a long halter.\n",
       "Wrangle left his browsing long enough to whinny and toss his head.\n",
       "Venters felt that he could not rest easily till he had secured the other\n",
       "rustler's horse; so, taking his rifle and calling for Ring, he set out.\n",
       "Swiftly yet watchfully he made his way through the canyon to the oval\n",
       "and out to the cattle trail. What few tracks might have betrayed him\n",
       "he obliterated, so only an expert tracker could have trailed him. Then,\n",
       "with many a wary backward glance across the sage, he started to round\n",
       "up the rustler's horse. This was unexpectedly easy. He led the horse to\n",
       "lower ground, out of sight from the opposite side of the oval along the\n",
       "shadowy western wall, and so on into his canyon and secluded camp.\n",
       "\n",
       "The girl's eyes were open; a feverish spot burned in her cheeks she\n",
       "moaned something unintelligible to Venters, but he took the movement of\n",
       "her lips to mean that she wanted water. Lifting her head, he tipped the\n",
       "canteen to her lips. After that she again lapsed into unconsciousness or\n",
       "a weakness which was its counterpart. Venters noted, however, that the\n",
       "burning flush had faded into the former pallor.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sun set behind the high canyon rim, and a cool shade darkened the\n",
       "walls. Venters fed the dogs and put a halter on the dead rustlers horse.\n",
       "He allowed Wrangle to browse free. This done, he cut spruce boughs and\n",
       "made a lean-to for the girl. Then, gently lifting her upon a blanket,\n",
       "he folded the sides over her. The other blanket he wrapped about his\n",
       "shoulders and found a comfortable seat against a spruce-tree that upheld\n",
       "the little shack. Ring and Whitie lay near at hand, one asleep, the\n",
       "other watchful.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters dreaded the night's vigil. At night his mind was active, and\n",
       "this time he had to watch and think and feel beside a dying girl whom\n",
       "he had all but murdered. A thousand excuses he invented for himself, yet\n",

       "\n",
       "“I'll bury her here,” thought Venters, “and let her grave be as much a\n",

       "“She was only a girl,” he soliloquized. “What was she to Oldring?\n",

       "all. But somehow... well, she may not have willingly become the companion\n",
       "of rustlers. That prayer of hers to God for mercy!... Life is strange\n",
       "and cruel. I wonder if other members of Oldring's gang are women? Likely\n",
       "enough. But what was his game? Oldring's Mask Rider! A name to make\n",
       "villagers hide and lock their doors. A name credited with a dozen\n",
       "murders, a hundred forays, and a thousand stealings of cattle. What\n",

       "Hours passed. The white stars moved across the narrow strip of dark-blue\n",
       "sky above. The silence awoke to the low hum of insects. Venters watched\n",
       "the immovable white face, and as he watched, hour by hour waiting for\n",
       "death, the infamy of her passed from his mind. He thought only of the\n",
       "sadness, the truth of the moment. Whoever she was--whatever she had\n",
       "done--she was young and she was dying.\n",
       "\n",
       "The after-part of the night wore on interminably. The starlight failed\n",
       "and the gloom blackened to the darkest hour. “She'll die at the gray\n",
       "of dawn,” muttered Venters, remembering some old woman's fancy. The\n",
       "blackness paled to gray, and the gray lightened and day peeped over\n",
       "the eastern rim. Venters listened at the breast of the girl. She\n",
       "still lived. Did he only imagine that her heart beat stronger, ever so\n",
       "slightly, but stronger? He pressed his ear closer to her breast. And he\n",
       "rose with his own pulse quickening.\n",
       "\n",
       "“If she doesn't die soon--she's got a chance--the barest chance to\n",
       "live,” he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "He wondered if the internal bleeding had ceased. There was no more film\n",
       "of blood upon her lips. But no corpse could have been whiter. Opening\n",
       "her blouse, he untied the scarf, and carefully picked away the sage\n",
       "leaves from the wound in her shoulder. It had closed. Lifting her\n",
       "lightly, he ascertained that the same was true of the hole where the\n",
       "bullet had come out. He reflected on the fact that clean wounds closed\n",
       "quickly in the healing upland air. He recalled instances of riders who\n",
       "had been cut and shot apparently to fatal issues; yet the blood had\n",
       "clotted, the wounds closed, and they had recovered. He had no way to\n",
       "tell if internal hemorrhage still went on, but he believed that it had\n",
       "stopped. Otherwise she would surely not have lived so long. He marked\n",
       "the entrance of the bullet, and concluded that it had just touched the\n",
       "upper lobe of her lung. Perhaps the wound in the lung had also closed.\n",
       "As he began to wash the blood stains from her breast and carefully\n",
       "rebandage the wound, he was vaguely conscious of a strange, grave\n",
       "happiness in the thought that she might live.\n",
       "\n",
       "Broad daylight and a hint of sunshine high on the cliff-rim to the west\n",
       "brought him to consideration of what he had better do. And while busy\n",
       "with his few camp tasks he revolved the thing in his mind. It would not\n",
       "be wise for him to remain long in his present hiding-place. And if he\n",
       "intended to follow the cattle trail and try to find the rustlers he had\n",
       "better make a move at once. For he knew that rustlers, being riders,\n",
       "would not make much of a day's or night's absence from camp for one\n",
       "or two of their number; but when the missing ones failed to show up in\n",
       "reasonable time there would be a search. And Venters was afraid of that.\n",
       "\n",
       "“A good tracker could trail me,” he muttered. “And I'd be cornered here.\n",
       "Let's see. Rustlers are a lazy set when they're not on the ride. I'll\n",
       "risk it. Then I'll change my hiding-place.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He carefully cleaned and reloaded his guns. When he rose to go he bent\n",
       "a long glance down upon the unconscious girl. Then ordering Whitie and\n",
       "Ring to keep guard, he left the camp.\n",
       "\n",
       "The safest cover lay close under the wall of the canyon, and here\n",
       "through the dense thickets Venters made his slow, listening advance\n",
       "toward the oval. Upon gaining the wide opening he decided to cross it\n",
       "and follow the left wall till he came to the cattle trail. He scanned\n",
       "the oval as keenly as if hunting for antelope. Then, stooping, he stole\n",
       "from one cover to another, taking advantage of rocks and bunches of\n",
       "sage, until he had reached the thickets under the opposite wall. Once\n",
       "there, he exercised extreme caution in his surveys of the ground ahead,\n",
       "but increased his speed when moving. Dodging from bush to bush, he\n",
       "passed the mouths of two canyons, and in the entrance of a third canyon\n",
       "he crossed a wash of swift clear water, to come abruptly upon the cattle\n",
       "trail.\n",
       "\n",
       "It followed the low bank of the wash, and, keeping it in sight, Venters\n",
       "hugged the line of sage and thicket. Like the curves of a serpent the\n",
       "canyon wound for a mile or more and then opened into a valley. Patches\n",
       "of red showed clear against the purple of sage, and farther out on the\n",
       "level dotted strings of red led away to the wall of rock.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ha, the red herd!” exclaimed Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then dots of white and black told him there were cattle of other colors\n",
       "in this inclosed valley. Oldring, the rustler, was also a rancher.\n",
       "Venters's calculating eye took count of stock that outnumbered the red\n",
       "herd.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What a range!” went on Venters. “Water and grass enough for fifty\n",
       "thousand head, and no riders needed!”\n",
       "\n",
       "After his first burst of surprise and rapid calculation Venters lost no\n",
       "time there, but slunk again into the sage on his back trail. With the\n",
       "discovery of Oldring's hidden cattle-range had come enlightenment\n",
       "on several problems. Here the rustler kept his stock, here was Jane\n",
       "Withersteen's red herd; here were the few cattle that had disappeared\n",
       "from the Cottonwoods slopes during the last two years. Until Oldring had\n",
       "driven the red herd his thefts of cattle for that time had not been\n",
       "more than enough to supply meat for his men. Of late no drives had been\n",
       "reported from Sterling or the villages north. And Venters knew that the\n",
       "riders had wondered at Oldring's inactivity in that particular field.\n",
       "He and his band had been active enough in their visits to Glaze and\n",
       "Cottonwoods; they always had gold; but of late the amount gambled\n",
       "away and drunk and thrown away in the villages had given rise to much\n",
       "conjecture. Oldring's more frequent visits had resulted in new saloons,\n",
       "and where there had formerly been one raid or shooting fray in the\n",
       "little hamlets there were now many. Perhaps Oldring had another range\n",
       "farther on up the pass, and from there drove the cattle to distant Utah\n",
       "towns where he was little known But Venters came finally to doubt this.\n",
       "And, from what he had learned in the last few days, a belief began to\n",
       "form in Venters's mind that Oldring's intimidations of the villages and\n",
       "the mystery of the Masked Rider, with his alleged evil deeds, and the\n",
       "fierce resistance offered any trailing riders, and the rustling of\n",
       "cattle--these things were only the craft of the rustler-chief to conceal\n",
       "his real life and purpose and work in Deception Pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "And like a scouting Indian Venters crawled through the sage of the oval\n",
       "valley, crossed trail after trail on the north side, and at last entered\n",
       "the canyon out of which headed the cattle trail, and into which he had\n",
       "watched the rustlers disappear.\n",
       "\n",
       "If he had used caution before, now he strained every nerve to force\n",
       "himself to creeping stealth and to sensitiveness of ear. He crawled\n",
       "along so hidden that he could not use his eyes except to aid himself in\n",
       "the toilsome progress through the brakes and ruins of cliff-wall. Yet\n",
       "from time to time, as he rested, he saw the massive red walls growing\n",
       "higher and wilder, more looming and broken. He made note of the fact\n",
       "that he was turning and climbing. The sage and thickets of oak and\n",
       "brakes of alder gave place to pinyon pine growing out of rocky soil.\n",
       "Suddenly a low, dull murmur assailed his ears. At first he thought it\n",
       "was thunder, then the slipping of a weathered slope of rock. But it was\n",
       "incessant, and as he progressed it filled out deeper and from a murmur\n",
       "changed into a soft roar.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Falling water,” he said. “There's volume to that. I wonder if it's the\n",
       "stream I lost.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The roar bothered him, for he could hear nothing else. Likewise,\n",
       "however, no rustlers could hear him. Emboldened by this and sure that\n",
       "nothing but a bird could see him, he arose from his hands and knees to\n",
       "hurry on. An opening in the pinyons warned him that he was nearing the\n",
       "height of slope.\n",
       "\n",
       "He gained it, and dropped low with a burst of astonishment. Before him\n",
       "stretched a short canyon with rounded stone floor bare of grass or sage\n",
       "or tree, and with curved, shelving walls. A broad rippling stream flowed\n",
       "toward him, and at the back of the canyon waterfall burst from a wide\n",
       "rent in the cliff, and, bounding down in two green steps, spread into a\n",
       "long white sheet.\n",
       "\n",
       "If Venters had not been indubitably certain that he had entered the\n",
       "right canyon his astonishment would not have been so great. There had\n",
       "been no breaks in the walls, no side canyons entering this one where the\n",
       "rustlers' tracks and the cattle trail had guided him, and, therefore, he\n",
       "could not be wrong. But here the canyon ended, and presumably the trails\n",
       "also.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That cattle trail headed out of here,” Venters kept saying to himself.\n",
       "“It headed out. Now what I want to know is how on earth did cattle ever\n",
       "get in here?”\n",
       "\n",
       "If he could be sure of anything it was of the careful scrutiny he had\n",
       "given that cattle track, every hoofmark of which headed straight west.\n",
       "He was now looking east at an immense round boxed corner of canyon down\n",
       "which tumbled a thin, white veil of water, scarcely twenty yards wide.\n",
       "Somehow, somewhere, his calculations had gone wrong. For the first time\n",
       "in years he found himself doubting his rider's skill in finding tracks,\n",
       "and his memory of what he had actually seen. In his anxiety to keep\n",
       "under cover he must have lost himself in this offshoot of Deception\n",
       "Pass, and thereby in some unaccountable manner, missed the canyon with\n",
       "the trails. There was nothing else for him to think. Rustlers could not\n",
       "fly, nor cattle jump down thousand-foot precipices. He was only proving\n",
       "what the sage-riders had long said of this labyrinthine system of\n",
       "deceitful canyons and valleys--trails led down into Deception Pass, but\n",
       "no rider had ever followed them.\n",
       "\n",
       "On a sudden he heard above the soft roar of the waterfall an unusual\n",
       "sound that he could not define. He dropped flat behind a stone and\n",
       "listened. From the direction he had come swelled something that\n",
       "resembled a strange muffled pounding and splashing and ringing. Despite\n",
       "his nerve the chill sweat began to dampen his forehead. What might not\n",
       "be possible in this stonewalled maze of mystery? The unnatural sound\n",
       "passed beyond him as he lay gripping his rifle and fighting for\n",
       "coolness. Then from the open came the sound, now distinct and different.\n",
       "Venters recognized a hobble-bell of a horse, and the cracking of iron on\n",
       "submerged stones, and the hollow splash of hoofs in water.\n",
       "\n",
       "Relief surged over him. His mind caught again at realities, and\n",
       "curiosity prompted him to peep from behind the rock.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the middle of the stream waded a long string of packed burros driven\n",
       "by three superbly mounted men. Had Venters met these dark-clothed,\n",
       "dark-visaged, heavily armed men anywhere in Utah, let alone in this\n",
       "robbers' retreat, he would have recognized them as rustlers. The\n",
       "discerning eye of a rider saw the signs of a long, arduous trip. These\n",
       "men were packing in supplies from one of the northern villages. They\n",
       "were tired, and their horses were almost played out, and the burros\n",
       "plodded on, after the manner of their kind when exhausted, faithful and\n",
       "patient, but as if every weary, splashing, slipping step would be their\n",
       "last.\n",
       "\n",
       "All this Venters noted in one glance. After that he watched with a\n",
       "thrilling eagerness. Straight at the waterfall the rustlers drove the\n",
       "burros, and straight through the middle, where the water spread into a\n",
       "fleecy, thin film like dissolving smoke. Following closely, the rustlers\n",
       "rode into this white mist, showing in bold black relief for an instant,\n",
       "and then they vanished.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters drew a full breath that rushed out in brief and sudden\n",
       "utterance.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Good Heaven! Of all the holes for a rustler!... There's a cavern under\n",
       "that waterfall, and a passageway leading out to a canyon beyond. Oldring\n",
       "hides in there. He needs only to guard a trail leading down from\n",
       "the sage-flat above. Little danger of this outlet to the pass being\n",
       "discovered. I stumbled on it by luck, after I had given up. And now I\n",
       "know the truth of what puzzled me most--why that cattle trail was wet!”\n",
       "\n",
       "He wheeled and ran down the slope, and out to the level of the\n",
       "sage-brush. Returning, he had no time to spare, only now and then,\n",
       "between dashes, a moment when he stopped to cast sharp eyes ahead. The\n",
       "abundant grass left no trace of his trail. Short work he made of the\n",
       "distance to the circle of canyons. He doubted that he would ever see it\n",
       "again; he knew he never wanted to; yet he looked at the red corners\n",
       "and towers with the eyes of a rider picturing landmarks never to be\n",
       "forgotten.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here he spent a panting moment in a slow-circling gaze of the sage-oval\n",
       "and the gaps between the bluffs. Nothing stirred except the gentle wave\n",
       "of the tips of the brush. Then he pressed on past the mouths of several\n",
       "canyons and over ground new to him, now close under the eastern wall.\n",
       "This latter part proved to be easy traveling, well screened from\n",
       "possible observation from the north and west, and he soon covered it\n",
       "and felt safer in the deepening shade of his own canyon. Then the huge,\n",
       "notched bulge of red rim loomed over him, a mark by which he knew again\n",
       "the deep cove where his camp lay hidden. As he penetrated the thicket,\n",
       "safe again for the present, his thoughts reverted to the girl he had\n",
       "left there. The afternoon had far advanced. How would he find her? He\n",
       "ran into camp, frightening the dogs.\n",
       "\n",
       "The girl lay with wide-open, dark eyes, and they dilated when he knelt\n",
       "beside her. The flush of fever shone in her cheeks. He lifted her and\n",
       "held water to her dry lips, and felt an inexplicable sense of lightness\n",
       "as he saw her swallow in a slow, choking gulp. Gently he laid her back.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Who--are--you?” she whispered, haltingly.\n",

       "source of great joy that through her they had come to soften in hatred.\n",
       "At any time this work called for a clearness of mind that precluded\n",

       "One of his daily duties was to give Black Star and Night and the other\n",

       "he would return on the morrow, and Jerd, in mingled surprise and relief,\n",
       "assured her he would always work for her. Jane missed the rattle and\n",
       "trot, canter and gallop of the incoming riders on the hard trails. Dusk\n",
       "shaded the grove where she walked; the birds ceased singing; the wind\n",
       "sighed through the leaves of the cottonwoods, and the running water\n",
       "murmured down its stone-bedded channel. The glimmering of the first star\n",
       "was like the peace and beauty of the night. Her faith welled up in her\n",
       "heart and said that all would soon be right in her little world. She\n",
       "pictured Venters about his lonely camp-fire sitting between his faithful\n",

       "from his red rages. Jane Withersteen realized that the spirit of wrath\n",
       "and war had lain dormant in her. She shrank from black depths hitherto\n",
       "unsuspected. The one thing in man or woman that she scorned above all\n",
       "scorn, and which she could not forgive, was hate. Hate headed a flaming\n",

       "wills with this man she would go to the wall. If she were to influence\n",
       "him it must be wholly through womanly allurement. There was that about\n",
       "Lassiter which commanded her respect. She had abhorred his name; face\n",
       "to face with him, she found she feared only his deeds. His mystic\n",
       "suggestion, his foreshadowing of something that she was to mean to him,\n",
       "pierced deep into her mind. She believed fate had thrown in her way the\n",
       "lover or husband of Milly Erne. She believed that through her an evil\n",
       "man might be reclaimed. His allusion to what he called her blindness\n",
       "terrified her. Such a mistaken idea of his might unleash the bitter,\n",
       "fatal mood she sensed in him. At any cost she must placate this man; she\n",
       "knew the die was cast, and that if Lassiter did not soften to a woman's\n",
       "grace and beauty and wiles, then it would be because she could not make\n",
       "him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon you'll hear no more such talk from me,” Lassiter went on,\n",

       "white steers is down on the slope behind them big ridges. An' I seen\n",
       "somethin' goin' on that'd be mighty interestin' to you, if you could see\n",

       "\n",
       "“Yes, I have two glasses. I'll get them and ride out with you. Wait,\n",
       "Lassiter, please,” she said, and hurried within. Sending word to Jerd to\n",
       "saddle Black Star and fetch him to the court, she then went to her room\n",
       "and changed to the riding-clothes she always donned when going into\n",
       "the sage. In this male attire her mirror showed her a jaunty, handsome\n",
       "rider. If she expected some little need of admiration from Lassiter, she\n",
       "had no cause for disappointment. The gentle smile that she liked, which\n",
       "made of him another person, slowly overspread his face.\n",
       "\n",
       "“If I didn't take you for a boy!” he exclaimed. “It's powerful queer\n",
       "what difference clothes make. Now I've been some scared of your dignity,\n",
       "like when the other night you was all in white but in this rig--”\n",
       "\n",
       "Black Star came pounding into the court, dragging Jerd half off his\n",
       "feet, and he whistled at Lassiter's black. But at sight of Jane all his\n",
       "defiant lines seemed to soften, and with tosses of his beautiful head he\n",
       "whipped his bridle.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Down, Black Star, down,” said Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "He dropped his head, and, slowly lengthening, he bent one foreleg, then\n",
       "the other, and sank to his knees. Jane slipped her left foot in the\n",
       "stirrup, swung lightly into the saddle, and Black Star rose with a\n",
       "ringing stamp. It was not easy for Jane to hold him to a canter through\n",
       "the grove, and like the wind he broke when he saw the sage. Jane let him\n",
       "have a couple of miles of free running on the open trail, and then she\n",
       "coaxed him in and waited for her companion. Lassiter was not long in\n",
       "catching up, and presently they were riding side by side. It reminded\n",
       "her how she used to ride with Venters. Where was he now? She gazed\n",
       "far down the slope to the curved purple lines of Deception Pass and\n",
       "involuntarily shut her eyes with a trembling stir of nameless fear.\n",
       "\n",

       "afraid.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He smiled as if he meant that bad news came swiftly enough without being\n",
       "presaged by speech.\n",
       "\n",
       "When they reached the lee of a rolling ridge Lassiter dismounted,\n",
       "motioning to her to do likewise. They left the horses standing, bridles\n",
       "down. Then Lassiter, carrying the field-glasses began to lead the way\n",
       "up the slow rise of ground. Upon nearing the summit he halted her with a\n",
       "gesture.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon we'd see more if we didn't show ourselves against the sky,”\n",
       " he said. “I was here less than an hour ago. Then the herd was seven or\n",
       "eight miles south, an' if they ain't bolted yet--”\n",

       "\n",
       "Jane climbed a few more paces behind him and then peeped over the ridge.\n",
       "Just beyond began a shallow swale that deepened and widened into a\n",
       "valley and then swung to the left. Following the undulating sweep of\n",
       "sage, Jane saw the straggling lines and then the great body of the white\n",
       "herd. She knew enough about steers, even at a distance of four or\n",
       "five miles, to realize that something was in the wind. Bringing her\n",
       "field-glass into use, she moved it slowly from left to right, which\n",
       "action swept the whole herd into range. The stragglers were restless;\n",
       "the more compactly massed steers were browsing. Jane brought the glass\n",
       "back to the big sentinels of the herd, and she saw them trot with quick\n",
       "steps, stop short and toss wide horns, look everywhere, and then trot in\n",
       "another direction.\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“Ah!” She made a fierce, passionate movement, clutched the glass\n",
       "tightly, shook as with the passing of a spasm, and then dropped her\n",
       "head. Presently she raised it to greet Lassiter with something like a\n",
       "smile. “My righteous brethren are at work again,” she said, in scorn.\n",
       "She had stifled the leap of her wrath, but for perhaps the first time\n",
       "in her life a bitter derision curled her lips. Lassiter's cool gray eyes\n",
       "seemed to pierce her. “I said I was prepared for anything; but that was\n",

       "bees pouring from a huge swarm, the steers stretched out from the main\n",
       "body. In a few moments, with astonishing rapidity, the whole herd got\n",
       "into motion. A faint roar of trampling hoofs came to Jane's ears, and\n",

       "\n",
       "The long, white, bobbing line of steers streaked swiftly through the\n",
       "sage, and a funnel-shaped dust-cloud arose at a low angle. A dull\n",
       "rumbling filled Jane's ears.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm thinkin' of millin' that herd,” said Lassiter. His gray glance\n",
       "swept up the slope to the west. “There's some specks an' dust way off\n",
       "toward the village. Mebbe that's Judkins an' his boys. It ain't likely\n",
       "he'll get here in time to help. You'd better hold Black Star here on\n",
       "this high ridge.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He ran to his horse and, throwing off saddle-bags and tightening the\n",
       "cinches, he leaped astride and galloped straight down across the valley.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane went for Black Star and, leading him to the summit of the ridge,\n",
       "she mounted and faced the valley with excitement and expectancy. She had\n",
       "heard of milling stampeded cattle, and knew it was a feat accomplished\n",
       "by only the most daring riders.\n",
       "\n",
       "The white herd was now strung out in a line two miles long. The dull\n",
       "rumble of thousands of hoofs deepened into continuous low thunder, and\n",
       "as the steers swept swiftly closer the thunder became a heavy roll.\n",
       "Lassiter crossed in a few moments the level of the valley to the eastern\n",
       "rise of ground and there waited the coming of the herd. Presently, as\n",
       "the head of the white line reached a point opposite to where Jane stood,\n",
       "Lassiter spurred his black into a run.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane saw him take a position on the off side of the leaders of the\n",
       "stampede, and there he rode. It was like a race. They swept on down the\n",
       "valley, and when the end of the white line neared Lassiter's first\n",
       "stand the head had begun to swing round to the west. It swung slowly and\n",
       "stubbornly, yet surely, and gradually assumed a long, beautiful curve of\n",
       "moving white. To Jane's amaze she saw the leaders swinging, turning till\n",
       "they headed back toward her and up the valley. Out to the right of\n",
       "these wild plunging steers ran Lassiter's black, and Jane's keen eye\n",
       "appreciated the fleet stride and sure-footedness of the blind horse.\n",
       "Then it seemed that the herd moved in a great curve, a huge half-moon\n",
       "with the points of head and tail almost opposite, and a mile apart But\n",
       "Lassiter relentlessly crowded the leaders, sheering them to the left,\n",
       "turning them little by little. And the dust-blinded wild followers\n",
       "plunged on madly in the tracks of their leaders. This ever-moving,\n",
       "ever-changing curve of steers rolled toward Jane and when below her,\n",
       "scarce half a mile, it began to narrow and close into a circle. Lassiter\n",
       "had ridden parallel with her position, turned toward her, then aside,\n",
       "and now he was riding directly away from her, all the time pushing the\n",
       "head of that bobbing line inward.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was then that Jane, suddenly understanding Lassiter's feat stared\n",
       "and gasped at the riding of this intrepid man. His horse was fleet and\n",
       "tireless, but blind. He had pushed the leaders around and around till\n",
       "they were about to turn in on the inner side of the end of that line\n",
       "of steers. The leaders were already running in a circle; the end of the\n",
       "herd was still running almost straight. But soon they would be wheeling.\n",
       "Then, when Lassiter had the circle formed, how would he escape? With\n",
       "Jane Withersteen prayer was as ready as praise; and she prayed for this\n",
       "man's safety. A circle of dust began to collect. Dimly, as through a\n",
       "yellow veil, Jane saw Lassiter press the leaders inward to close the gap\n",
       "in the sage. She lost sight of him in the dust, again she thought she\n",
       "saw the black, riderless now, rear and drag himself and fall. Lassiter\n",
       "had been thrown--lost! Then he reappeared running out of the dust into\n",
       "the sage. He had escaped, and she breathed again.\n",
       "\n",
       "Spellbound, Jane Withersteen watched this stupendous millwheel of\n",
       "steers. Here was the milling of the herd. The white running circle\n",
       "closed in upon the open space of sage. And the dust circles closed above\n",
       "into a pall. The ground quaked and the incessant thunder of pounding\n",
       "hoofs rolled on. Jane felt deafened, yet she thrilled to a new sound. As\n",
       "the circle of sage lessened the steers began to bawl, and when it closed\n",
       "entirely there came a great upheaval in the center, and a terrible\n",
       "thumping of heads and clicking of horns. Bawling, climbing, goring, the\n",
       "great mass of steers on the inside wrestled in a crashing din, heaved\n",
       "and groaned under the pressure. Then came a deadlock. The inner strife\n",
       "ceased, and the hideous roar and crash. Movement went on in the outer\n",
       "circle, and that, too, gradually stilled. The white herd had come to a\n",
       "stop, and the pall of yellow dust began to drift away on the wind.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane Withersteen waited on the ridge with full and grateful heart.\n",

       "do that. It's not easy. The kind of happiness you want I wanted once. I\n",
       "never got it, nor will you, unless you throw away your soul. We've all\n",

       "platform entrances, and the saloons where tired horses stood with\n",
       "bridles dragging, she was again assured of what was the bread and wine\n",
       "of life to her--that she was loved. Dirty boys playing in the ditch,\n",
       "clerks, teamsters, riders, loungers on the corners, ranchers on dusty\n",

       "and here some thirty Gentile families lived in huts and shacks and\n",
       "log-cabins and several dilapidated cottages. The fortunes of these\n",
       "inhabitants of Cottonwoods could be read in their abodes. Water they had\n",
       "in abundance, and therefore grass and fruit-trees and patches of alfalfa\n",
       "and vegetable gardens. Some of the men and boys had a few stray cattle,\n",
       "others obtained such intermittent employment as the Mormons reluctantly\n",
       "tendered them. But none of the families was prosperous, many were very\n",
       "poor, and some lived only by Jane Withersteen's beneficence.\n",

       "by the children. But poverty and idleness, with their attendant\n",
       "wretchedness and sorrow, always hurt her. That she could alleviate this\n",
       "distress more now than ever before proved the adage that it was an ill\n",
       "wind that blew nobody good. While her Mormon riders were in her employ\n",
       "she had found few Gentiles who would stay with her, and now she was able\n",

       "rows of vegetables, such as the hand of a weak woman had time and\n",
       "strength to cultivate. This little dwelling-place was just outside the\n",

       "unfenced yard a child saw her, shrieked with joy, and came tearing\n",
       "toward her with curls flying. This child was a little girl of four\n",

       "body. Red as cherries were her cheeks and lips; her eyes were violet\n",
       "blue, and the crown of her childish loveliness was the curling golden\n",
       "hair. All the children of Cottonwoods were Jane Withersteen's friends,\n",
       "she loved them all. But Fay was dearest to her. Fay had few playmates,\n",
       "for among the Gentile children there were none near her age, and the\n",

       "clean and neat. A woman lay upon a bed.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Mrs. Larkin, how are you?” asked Jane, anxiously.\n",

       "domination, running its secret lines this time into her own household.\n",
       "Like a spider in the blackness of night an unseen hand had begun to run\n",

       "offer, and now I'll tell you why.”\n",

       "this: I told all my friends what you wanted. They know you, care for\n",
       "you, and they said for me to trust Fay to you. Women will talk, you\n",

       "your wanting her. And it came straight back to me, in jealousy, perhaps,\n",

       "believed it at heart. And now I guess I'll let you--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Wait! Mrs. Larkin, I may have told little white lies in my life, but\n",
       "never a lie that mattered, that hurt any one. Now believe me. I love\n",
       "little Fay. If I had her near me I'd grow to worship her. When I asked\n",
       "for her I thought only of that love.... Let me prove this. You and Fay\n",
       "come to live with me. I've such a big house, and I'm so lonely. I'll\n",
       "help nurse you, take care of you. When you're better you can work for\n",
       "me. I'll keep little Fay and bring her up--without Mormon teaching.\n",
       "When she's grown, if she should want to leave me, I'll send her, and not\n",

       "\n",
       "Back in that strange canyon, which Venters had found indeed a valley of\n",
       "surprises, the wounded girl's whispered appeal, almost a prayer, not to\n",
       "take her back to the rustlers crowned the events of the last few days\n",
       "with a confounding climax. That she should not want to return to them\n",
       "staggered Venters. Presently, as logical thought returned, her appeal\n",
       "confirmed his first impression--that she was more unfortunate than\n",
       "bad--and he experienced a sensation of gladness. If he had known before\n",
       "that Oldring's Masked Rider was a woman his opinion would have been\n",
       "formed and he would have considered her abandoned. But his first\n",
       "knowledge had come when he lifted a white face quivering in a convulsion\n",
       "of agony; he had heard God's name whispered by blood-stained lips;\n",
       "through her solemn and awful eyes he had caught a glimpse\n",
       "of her soul. And just now had come the entreaty to him,\n",
       "“Don't--take--me--back--there!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Once for all Venters's quick mind formed a permanent conception of this\n",
       "poor girl. He based it, not upon what the chances of life had made her,\n",
       "but upon the revelation of dark eyes that pierced the infinite, upon a\n",
       "few pitiful, halting words that betrayed failure and wrong and misery,\n",
       "yet breathed the truth of a tragic fate rather than a natural leaning to\n",
       "evil.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What's your name?” he inquired.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess,” she answered.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess what?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“That's enough--just Bess.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The red that deepened in her cheeks was not all the flush of fever.\n",
       "Venters marveled anew, and this time at the tint of shame in her face,\n",
       "at the momentary drooping of long lashes. She might be a rustler's girl,\n",
       "but she was still capable of shame, she might be dying, but she still\n",
       "clung to some little remnant of honor.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Very well, Bess. It doesn't matter,” he said. “But this matters--what\n",
       "shall I do with you?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Are--you--a rider?” she whispered.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Not now. I was once. I drove the Withersteen herds. But I lost my\n",
       "place--lost all I owned--and now I'm--I'm a sort of outcast. My name's\n",
       "Bern Venters.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“You won't--take me--to Cottonwoods--or Glaze? I'd be--hanged.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, indeed. But I must do something with you. For it's not safe for\n",
       "me here. I shot that rustler who was with you. Sooner or later he'll\n",
       "be found, and then my tracks. I must find a safer hiding-place where I\n",
       "can't be trailed.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Leave me--here.”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“Yes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I will not.” Venters spoke shortly with a kind of ring in his voice.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What--do you want--to do--with me?” Her whispering grew difficult, so\n",
       "low and faint that Venters had to stoop to hear her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why, let's see,” he replied, slowly. “I'd like to take you some place\n",
       "where I could watch by you, nurse you, till you're all right.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“And--then?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, it'll be time to think of that when you're cured of your wound.\n",
       "It's a bad one. And--Bess, if you don't want to live--if you don't fight\n",
       "for life--you'll never--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh! I want--to live! I'm afraid--to die. But I'd rather--die--than go\n",
       "back--to--to--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“To Oldring?” asked Venters, interrupting her in turn.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her lips moved in an affirmative.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I promise not to take you back to him or to Cottonwoods or to Glaze.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The mournful earnestness of her gaze suddenly shone with unutterable\n",
       "gratitude and wonder. And as suddenly Venters found her eyes beautiful\n",
       "as he had never seen or felt beauty. They were as dark blue as the sky\n",
       "at night. Then the flashing changed to a long, thoughtful look, in which\n",
       "there was a wistful, unconscious searching of his face, a look that\n",
       "trembled on the verge of hope and trust.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'll try--to live,” she said. The broken whisper just reached his ears.\n",
       "“Do what--you want--with me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Rest then--don't worry--sleep,” he replied.\n",
       "\n",
       "Abruptly he arose, as if words had been decision for him, and with a\n",
       "sharp command to the dogs he strode from the camp. Venters was conscious\n",
       "of an indefinite conflict of change within him. It seemed to be a\n",
       "vague passing of old moods, a dim coalescing of new forces, a moment of\n",
       "inexplicable transition. He was both cast down and uplifted. He wanted\n",
       "to think and think of the meaning, but he resolutely dispelled emotion.\n",
       "His imperative need at present was to find a safe retreat, and this\n",
       "called for action.\n",
       "\n",
       "So he set out. It still wanted several hours before dark. This trip he\n",
       "turned to the left and wended his skulking way southward a mile or more\n",
       "to the opening of the valley, where lay the strange scrawled rocks. He\n",
       "did not, however, venture boldly out into the open sage, but clung to\n",
       "the right-hand wall and went along that till its perpendicular line\n",
       "broke into the long incline of bare stone.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before proceeding farther he halted, studying the strange character of\n",
       "this slope and realizing that a moving black object could be seen far\n",
       "against such background. Before him ascended a gradual swell of smooth\n",
       "stone. It was hard, polished, and full of pockets worn by centuries\n",
       "of eddying rain-water. A hundred yards up began a line of grotesque\n",
       "cedar-trees, and they extended along the slope clear to its most\n",
       "southerly end. Beyond that end Venters wanted to get, and he concluded\n",
       "the cedars, few as they were, would afford some cover.\n",
       "\n",
       "Therefore he climbed swiftly. The trees were farther up than he\n",
       "had estimated, though he had from long habit made allowance for the\n",
       "deceiving nature of distances in that country. When he gained the cover\n",
       "of cedars he paused to rest and look, and it was then he saw how the\n",
       "trees sprang from holes in the bare rock. Ages of rain had run down the\n",
       "slope, circling, eddying in depressions, wearing deep round holes.\n",
       "There had been dry seasons, accumulations of dust, wind-blown seeds, and\n",
       "cedars rose wonderfully out of solid rock. But these were not beautiful\n",
       "cedars. They were gnarled, twisted into weird contortions, as if growth\n",
       "were torture, dead at the tops, shrunken, gray, and old. Theirs had\n",
       "been a bitter fight, and Venters felt a strange sympathy for them. This\n",
       "country was hard on trees--and men.\n",
       "\n",
       "He slipped from cedar to cedar, keeping them between him and the open\n",
       "valley. As he progressed, the belt of trees widened and he kept to its\n",
       "upper margin. He passed shady pockets half full of water, and, as he\n",
       "marked the location for possible future need, he reflected that there\n",
       "had been no rain since the winter snows. From one of these shady holes a\n",
       "rabbit hopped out and squatted down, laying its ears flat.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters wanted fresh meat now more than when he had only himself to\n",
       "think of. But it would not do to fire his rifle there. So he broke off\n",
       "a cedar branch and threw it. He crippled the rabbit, which started to\n",
       "flounder up the slope. Venters did not wish to lose the meat, and\n",
       "he never allowed crippled game to escape, to die lingeringly in some\n",
       "covert. So after a careful glance below, and back toward the canyon, he\n",
       "began to chase the rabbit.\n",
       "\n",
       "The fact that rabbits generally ran uphill was not new to him. But\n",
       "it presently seemed singular why this rabbit, that might have escaped\n",
       "downward, chose to ascend the slope. Venters knew then that it had a\n",
       "burrow higher up. More than once he jerked over to seize it, only in\n",
       "vain, for the rabbit by renewed effort eluded his grasp. Thus the chase\n",
       "continued on up the bare slope. The farther Venters climbed the more\n",
       "determined he grew to catch his quarry. At last, panting and sweating,\n",
       "he captured the rabbit at the foot of a steeper grade. Laying his rifle\n",
       "on the bulge of rising stone, he killed the animal and slung it from his\n",
       "belt.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before starting down he waited to catch his breath. He had climbed\n",
       "far up that wonderful smooth slope, and had almost reached the base\n",
       "of yellow cliff that rose skyward, a huge scarred and cracked bulk. It\n",
       "frowned down upon him as if to forbid further ascent. Venters bent over\n",
       "for his rifle, and, as he picked it up from where it leaned against the\n",
       "steeper grade, he saw several little nicks cut in the solid stone.\n",
       "\n",
       "They were only a few inches deep and about a foot apart. Venters began\n",
       "to count them--one--two--three--four--on up to sixteen. That number\n",
       "carried his glance to the top of his first bulging bench of cliff-base.\n",
       "Above, after a more level offset, was still steeper slope, and the line\n",
       "of nicks kept on, to wind round a projecting corner of wall.\n",
       "\n",
       "A casual glance would have passed by these little dents; if Venters had\n",
       "not known what they signified he would never have bestowed upon them the\n",
       "second glance. But he knew they had been cut there by hand, and,\n",
       "though age-worn, he recognized them as steps cut in the rock by the\n",
       "cliff-dwellers. With a pulse beginning to beat and hammer away his\n",
       "calmness, he eyed that indistinct line of steps, up to where the\n",
       "buttress of wall hid further sight of them. He knew that behind\n",
       "the corner of stone would be a cave or a crack which could never be\n",
       "suspected from below. Chance, that had sported with him of late, now\n",
       "directed him to a probable hiding-place. Again he laid aside his rifle,\n",
       "and, removing boots and belt, he began to walk up the steps. Like a\n",
       "mountain goat, he was agile, sure-footed, and he mounted the first bench\n",
       "without bending to use his hands. The next ascent took grip of fingers\n",
       "as well as toes, but he climbed steadily, swiftly, to reach the\n",
       "projecting corner, and slipped around it. Here he faced a notch in the\n",
       "cliff. At the apex he turned abruptly into a ragged vent that split the\n",
       "ponderous wall clear to the top, showing a narrow streak of blue sky.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the base this vent was dark, cool, and smelled of dry, musty dust.\n",
       "It zigzagged so that he could not see ahead more than a few yards at a\n",
       "time. He noticed tracks of wildcats and rabbits in the dusty floor. At\n",
       "every turn he expected to come upon a huge cavern full of little square\n",
       "stone houses, each with a small aperture like a staring dark eye. The\n",
       "passage lightened and widened, and opened at the foot of a narrow,\n",
       "steep, ascending chute.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters had a moment's notice of the rock, which was of the same\n",
       "smoothness and hardness as the slope below, before his gaze went\n",
       "irresistibly upward to the precipitous walls of this wide ladder of\n",
       "granite. These were ruined walls of yellow sandstone, and so split and\n",
       "splintered, so overhanging with great sections of balancing rim, so\n",
       "impending with tremendous crumbling crags, that Venters caught his\n",
       "breath sharply, and, appalled, he instinctively recoiled as if a step\n",
       "upward might jar the ponderous cliffs from their foundation. Indeed, it\n",
       "seemed that these ruined cliffs were but awaiting a breath of wind\n",
       "to collapse and come tumbling down. Venters hesitated. It would be a\n",
       "foolhardy man who risked his life under the leaning, waiting avalanches\n",
       "of rock in that gigantic split. Yet how many years had they leaned there\n",
       "without falling! At the bottom of the incline was an immense heap of\n",
       "weathered sandstone all crumbling to dust, but there were no huge rocks\n",
       "as large as houses, such as rested so lightly and frightfully above,\n",
       "waiting patiently and inevitably to crash down. Slowly split from the\n",
       "parent rock by the weathering process, and carved and sculptured by ages\n",
       "of wind and rain, they waited their moment. Venters felt how foolish\n",
       "it was for him to fear these broken walls; to fear that, after they had\n",
       "endured for thousands of years, the moment of his passing should be the\n",
       "one for them to slip. Yet he feared it.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What a place to hide!” muttered Venters. “I'll climb--I'll see where\n",
       "this thing goes. If only I can find water!”\n",
       "\n",
       "With teeth tight shut he essayed the incline. And as he climbed he bent\n",
       "his eyes downward. This, however, after a little grew impossible; he had\n",
       "to look to obey his eager, curious mind. He raised his glance and saw\n",
       "light between row on row of shafts and pinnacles and crags that stood\n",
       "out from the main wall. Some leaned against the cliff, others against\n",
       "each other; many stood sheer and alone; all were crumbling, cracked,\n",
       "rotten. It was a place of yellow, ragged ruin. The passage narrowed as\n",
       "he went up; it became a slant, hard for him to stick on; it was smooth\n",
       "as marble. Finally he surmounted it, surprised to find the walls still\n",
       "several hundred feet high, and a narrow gorge leading down on the other\n",
       "side. This was a divide between two inclines, about twenty yards wide.\n",
       "At one side stood an enormous rock. Venters gave it a second glance,\n",
       "because it rested on a pedestal. It attracted closer attention. It was\n",
       "like a colossal pear of stone standing on its stem. Around the bottom\n",
       "were thousands of little nicks just distinguishable to the eye. They\n",
       "were marks of stone hatchets. The cliff-dwellers had chipped and chipped\n",
       "away at this boulder till it rested its tremendous bulk upon a mere\n",
       "pin-point of its surface. Venters pondered. Why had the little stone-men\n",
       "hacked away at that big boulder? It bore no semblance to a statue or an\n",
       "idol or a godhead or a sphinx. Instinctively he put his hands on it\n",
       "and pushed; then his shoulder and heaved. The stone seemed to groan, to\n",
       "stir, to grate, and then to move. It tipped a little downward and hung\n",
       "balancing for a long instant, slowly returned, rocked slightly, groaned,\n",
       "and settled back to its former position.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters divined its significance. It had been meant for defense. The\n",
       "cliff-dwellers, driven by dreaded enemies to this last stand, had\n",
       "cunningly cut the rock until it balanced perfectly, ready to be\n",
       "dislodged by strong hands. Just below it leaned a tottering crag that\n",
       "would have toppled, starting an avalanche on an acclivity where no\n",
       "sliding mass could stop. Crags and pinnacles, splintered cliffs, and\n",
       "leaning shafts and monuments, would have thundered down to block forever\n",
       "the outlet to Deception Pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That was a narrow shave for me,” said Venters, soberly. “A balancing\n",
       "rock! The cliff-dwellers never had to roll it. They died, vanished,\n",
       "and here the rock stands, probably little changed.... But it might serve\n",
       "another lonely dweller of the cliffs. I'll hide up here somewhere, if I\n",
       "can only find water.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He descended the gorge on the other side. The slope was gradual, the\n",
       "space narrow, the course straight for many rods. A gloom hung between\n",
       "the up-sweeping walls. In a turn the passage narrowed to scarce a dozen\n",
       "feet, and here was darkness of night. But light shone ahead; another\n",
       "abrupt turn brought day again, and then wide open space.\n",
       "\n",
       "Above Venters loomed a wonderful arch of stone bridging the canyon rims,\n",
       "and through the enormous round portal gleamed and glistened a beautiful\n",
       "valley shining under sunset gold reflected by surrounding cliffs. He\n",
       "gave a start of surprise. The valley was a cove a mile long, half\n",
       "that wide, and its enclosing walls were smooth and stained, and curved\n",
       "inward, forming great caves. He decided that its floor was far higher\n",
       "than the level of Deception Pass and the intersecting canyons. No purple\n",
       "sage colored this valley floor. Instead there were the white of aspens,\n",
       "streaks of branch and slender trunk glistening from the green of leaves,\n",
       "and the darker green of oaks, and through the middle of this forest,\n",
       "from wall to wall, ran a winding line of brilliant green which marked\n",
       "the course of cottonwoods and willows.\n",
       "\n",
       "“There's water here--and this is the place for me,” said Venters. “Only\n",
       "birds can peep over those walls, I've gone Oldring one better.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters waited no longer, and turned swiftly to retrace his steps. He\n",
       "named the canyon Surprise Valley and the huge boulder that guarded the\n",
       "outlet Balancing Rock. Going down he did not find himself attended by\n",
       "such fears as had beset him in the climb; still, he was not easy in\n",
       "mind and could not occupy himself with plans of moving the girl and his\n",
       "outfit until he had descended to the notch. There he rested a moment and\n",
       "looked about him. The pass was darkening with the approach of night. At\n",
       "the corner of the wall, where the stone steps turned, he saw a spur of\n",
       "rock that would serve to hold the noose of a lasso. He needed no more\n",
       "aid to scale that place. As he intended to make the move under cover\n",
       "of darkness, he wanted most to be able to tell where to climb up. So,\n",
       "taking several small stones with him, he stepped and slid down to the\n",
       "edge of the slope where he had left his rifle and boots. He placed the\n",
       "stones some yards apart. He left the rabbit lying upon the bench where\n",
       "the steps began. Then he addressed a keen-sighted, remembering gaze to\n",
       "the rim-wall above. It was serrated, and between two spears of rock,\n",
       "directly in line with his position, showed a zigzag crack that at night\n",
       "would let through the gleam of sky. This settled, he put on his belt\n",
       "and boots and prepared to descend. Some consideration was necessary to\n",
       "decide whether or not to leave his rifle there. On the return, carrying\n",
       "the girl and a pack, it would be added encumbrance; and after debating\n",
       "the matter he left the rifle leaning against the bench. As he went\n",
       "straight down the slope he halted every few rods to look up at his mark\n",
       "on the rim. It changed, but he fixed each change in his memory. When he\n",
       "reached the first cedar-tree, he tied his scarf upon a dead branch, and\n",
       "then hurried toward camp, having no more concern about finding his trail\n",
       "upon the return trip.\n",
       "\n",
       "Darkness soon emboldened and lent him greater speed. It occurred to him,\n",
       "as he glided into the grassy glade near camp and head the whinny of a\n",
       "horse, that he had forgotten Wrangle. The big sorrel could not be gotten\n",
       "into Surprise Valley. He would have to be left here.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters determined at once to lead the other horses out through the\n",
       "thicket and turn them loose. The farther they wandered from this canyon\n",
       "the better it would suit him. He easily descried Wrangle through the\n",
       "gloom, but the others were not in sight. Venters whistled low for the\n",
       "dogs, and when they came trotting to him he sent them out to search for\n",
       "the horses, and followed. It soon developed that they were not in the\n",
       "glade nor the thicket. Venters grew cold and rigid at the thought of\n",
       "rustlers having entered his retreat. But the thought passed, for the\n",
       "demeanor of Ring and Whitie reassured him. The horses had wandered away.\n",
       "\n",
       "Under the clump of silver spruces a denser mantle of darkness, yet not\n",
       "so thick that Venter's night-practiced eyes could not catch the white\n",
       "oval of a still face. He bent over it with a slight suspension of breath\n",
       "that was both caution lest he frighten her and chill uncertainty of\n",
       "feeling lest he find her dead. But she slept, and he arose to renewed\n",
       "activity.\n",
       "\n",
       "He packed his saddle-bags. The dogs were hungry, they whined about\n",
       "him and nosed his busy hands; but he took no time to feed them nor to\n",
       "satisfy his own hunger. He slung the saddlebags over his shoulders and\n",
       "made them secure with his lasso. Then he wrapped the blankets closer\n",
       "about the girl and lifted her in his arms. Wrangle whinnied and thumped\n",
       "the ground as Venters passed him with the dogs. The sorrel knew he was\n",
       "being left behind, and was not sure whether he liked it or not. Venters\n",
       "went on and entered the thicket. Here he had to feel his way in pitch\n",
       "blackness and to wedge his progress between the close saplings. Time\n",
       "meant little to him now that he had started, and he edged along with\n",
       "slow side movement till he got clear of the thicket. Ring and Whitie\n",
       "stood waiting for him. Taking to the open aisles and patches of the\n",
       "sage, he walked guardedly, careful not to stumble or step in dust or\n",
       "strike against spreading sage-branches.\n",
       "\n",
       "If he were burdened he did not feel it. From time to time, when he\n",
       "passed out of the black lines of shade into the wan starlight, he\n",
       "glanced at the white face of the girl lying in his arms. She had not\n",
       "awakened from her sleep or stupor. He did not rest until he cleared the\n",
       "black gate of the canyon. Then he leaned against a stone breast-high to\n",
       "him and gently released the girl from his hold. His brow and hair\n",
       "and the palms of his hands were wet, and there was a kind of nervous\n",
       "contraction of his muscles. They seemed to ripple and string tense. He\n",
       "had a desire to hurry and no sense of fatigue. A wind blew the scent\n",
       "of sage in his face. The first early blackness of night passed with the\n",
       "brightening of the stars. Somewhere back on his trail a coyote yelped,\n",
       "splitting the dead silence. Venters's faculties seemed singularly acute.\n",
       "\n",
       "He lifted the girl again and pressed on. The valley better traveling\n",
       "than the canyon. It was lighter, freer of sage, and there were no rocks.\n",
       "Soon, out of the pale gloom shone a still paler thing, and that was the\n",
       "low swell of slope. Venters mounted it and his dogs walked beside him.\n",
       "Once upon the stone he slowed to snail pace, straining his sight to\n",
       "avoid the pockets and holes. Foot by foot he went up. The weird cedars,\n",
       "like great demons and witches chained to the rock and writhing in silent\n",
       "anguish, loomed up with wide and twisting naked arms. Venters crossed\n",
       "this belt of cedars, skirted the upper border, and recognized the tree\n",
       "he had marked, even before he saw his waving scarf.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here he knelt and deposited the girl gently, feet first and slowly laid\n",
       "her out full length. What he feared was to reopen one of her wounds.\n",
       "If he gave her a violent jar, or slipped and fell! But the supreme\n",
       "confidence so strangely felt that night admitted no such blunders.\n",
       "\n",
       "The slope before him seemed to swell into obscurity to lose its definite\n",
       "outline in a misty, opaque cloud that shaded into the over-shadowing\n",
       "wall. He scanned the rim where the serrated points speared the sky, and\n",
       "he found the zigzag crack. It was dim, only a shade lighter than the\n",
       "dark ramparts, but he distinguished it, and that served.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lifting the girl, he stepped upward, closely attending to the nature of\n",
       "the path under his feet. After a few steps he stopped to mark his line\n",
       "with the crack in the rim. The dogs clung closer to him. While chasing\n",
       "the rabbit this slope had appeared interminable to him; now, burdened as\n",
       "he was, he did not think of length or height or toil. He remembered\n",
       "only to avoid a misstep and to keep his direction. He climbed on, with\n",
       "frequent stops to watch the rim, and before he dreamed of gaining the\n",
       "bench he bumped his knees into it, and saw, in the dim gray light, his\n",
       "rifle and the rabbit. He had come straight up without mishap or swerving\n",
       "off his course, and his shut teeth unlocked.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he laid the girl down in the shallow hollow of the little ridge with\n",
       "her white face upturned, she opened her eyes. Wide, staring black, at\n",
       "once like both the night and the stars, they made her face seem still\n",
       "whiter.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Is--it--you?” she asked, faintly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes,” replied Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh! Where--are we?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm taking you to a safe place where no one will ever find you. I must\n",
       "climb a little here and call the dogs. Don't be afraid. I'll soon come\n",
       "for you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "She said no more. Her eyes watched him steadily for a moment and then\n",
       "closed. Venters pulled off his boots and then felt for the little steps\n",
       "in the rock. The shade of the cliff above obscured the point he wanted\n",
       "to gain, but he could see dimly a few feet before him. What he had\n",
       "attempted with care he now went at with surpassing lightness. Buoyant,\n",
       "rapid, sure, he attained the corner of wall and slipped around it. Here\n",
       "he could not see a hand before his face, so he groped along, found a\n",
       "little flat space, and there removed the saddle-bags. The lasso he took\n",
       "back with him to the corner and looped the noose over the spur of rock.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ring--Whitie--come,” he called, softly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Low whines came up from below.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Here! Come, Whitie--Ring,” he repeated, this time sharply.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then followed scraping of claws and pattering of feet; and out of the\n",
       "gray gloom below him swiftly climbed the dogs to reach his side and pass\n",
       "beyond.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters descended, holding to the lasso. He tested its strength by\n",
       "throwing all his weight upon it. Then he gathered the girl up, and,\n",
       "holding her securely in his left arm, he began to climb, at every few\n",
       "steps jerking his right hand upward along the lasso. It sagged at each\n",
       "forward movement he made, but he balanced himself lightly during the\n",
       "interval when he lacked the support of a taut rope. He climbed as if he\n",
       "had wings, the strength of a giant, and knew not the sense of fear. The\n",
       "sharp corner of cliff seemed to cut out of the darkness. He reached\n",
       "it and the protruding shelf, and then, entering the black shade of the\n",
       "notch, he moved blindly but surely to the place where he had left the\n",
       "saddle-bags. He heard the dogs, though he could not see them. Once more\n",
       "he carefully placed the girl at his feet. Then, on hands and knees,\n",
       "he went over the little flat space, feeling for stones. He removed a\n",
       "number, and, scraping the deep dust into a heap, he unfolded the outer\n",
       "blanket from around the girl and laid her upon this bed. Then he went\n",
       "down the slope again for his boots, rifle, and the rabbit, and, bringing\n",
       "also his lasso with him, he made short work of that trip.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Are--you--there?” The girl's voice came low from the blackness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes,” he replied, and was conscious that his laboring breast made\n",
       "speech difficult.\n",
       "\n",

       "starlight, a dark overcasting of sky, an hour or so of gray gloom, and\n",
       "then the lighting of dawn.\n",
       "\n",
       "When he had bestirred himself, feeding the hungry dogs and breaking\n",
       "his long fast, and had repacked his saddle-bags, it was clear daylight,\n",
       "though the sun had not tipped the yellow wall in the east. He concluded\n",
       "to make the climb and descent into Surprise Valley in one trip. To that\n",
       "end he tied his blanket upon Ring and gave Whitie the extra lasso and\n",
       "the rabbit to carry. Then, with the rifle and saddle-bags slung upon his\n",
       "back, he took up the girl. She did not awaken from heavy slumber.\n",
       "\n",
       "That climb up under the rugged, menacing brows of the broken cliffs,\n",
       "in the face of a grim, leaning boulder that seemed to be weary of its\n",
       "age-long wavering, was a tax on strength and nerve that Venters\n",
       "felt equally with something sweet and strangely exulting in its\n",
       "accomplishment. He did not pause until he gained the narrow divide and\n",
       "there he rested. Balancing Rock loomed huge, cold in the gray light\n",
       "of dawn, a thing without life, yet it spoke silently to Venters: “I am\n",
       "waiting to plunge down, to shatter and crash, roar and boom, to bury\n",
       "your trail, and close forever the outlet to Deception Pass!”\n",
       "\n",
       "On the descent of the other side Venters had easy going, but was\n",
       "somewhat concerned because Whitie appeared to have succumbed to\n",
       "temptation, and while carrying the rabbit was also chewing on it. And\n",
       "Ring evidently regarded this as an injury to himself, especially as he\n",
       "had carried the heavier load. Presently he snapped at one end of the\n",
       "rabbit and refused to let go. But his action prevented Whitie from\n",
       "further misdoing, and then the two dogs pattered down, carrying the\n",
       "rabbit between them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters turned out of the gorge, and suddenly paused stock-still,\n",
       "astounded at the scene before him. The curve of the great stone bridge\n",
       "had caught the sunrise, and through the magnificent arch burst a\n",
       "glorious stream of gold that shone with a long slant down into the\n",
       "center of Surprise Valley. Only through the arch did any sunlight\n",
       "pass, so that all the rest of the valley lay still asleep, dark green,\n",
       "mysterious, shadowy, merging its level into walls as misty and soft as\n",
       "morning clouds.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters then descended, passing through the arch, looking up at its\n",
       "tremendous height and sweep. It spanned the opening to Surprise Valley,\n",
       "stretching in almost perfect curve from rim to rim. Even in his hurry\n",
       "and concern Venters could not but feel its majesty, and the thought came\n",
       "to him that the cliff-dwellers must have regarded it as an object of\n",
       "worship.\n",
       "\n",
       "Down, down, down Venters strode, more and more feeling the weight of his\n",
       "burden as he descended, and still the valley lay below him. As all\n",
       "other canyons and coves and valleys had deceived him, so had this deep,\n",
       "nestling oval. At length he passed beyond the slope of weathered stone\n",
       "that spread fan-shape from the arch, and encountered a grassy terrace\n",
       "running to the right and about on a level with the tips of the oaks and\n",
       "cottonwoods below. Scattered here and there upon this shelf were clumps\n",
       "of aspens, and he walked through them into a glade that surpassed in\n",
       "beauty and adaptability for a wild home, any place he had ever seen.\n",
       "Silver spruces bordered the base of a precipitous wall that rose\n",
       "loftily. Caves indented its surface, and there were no detached ledges\n",
       "or weathered sections that might dislodge a stone. The level ground,\n",
       "beyond the spruces, dropped down into a little ravine. This was one\n",
       "dense line of slender aspens from which came the low splashing of water.\n",
       "And the terrace, lying open to the west, afforded unobstructed view of\n",
       "the valley of green treetops.\n",
       "\n",
       "For his camp Venters chose a shady, grassy plot between the silver\n",
       "spruces and the cliff. Here, in the stone wall, had been wonderfully\n",
       "carved by wind or washed by water several deep caves above the level of\n",
       "the terrace. They were clean, dry, roomy.\n",
       "\n",
       "He cut spruce boughs and made a bed in the largest cave and laid the\n",
       "girl there. The first intimation that he had of her being aroused from\n",
       "sleep or lethargy was a low call for water.\n",
       "\n",
       "He hurried down into the ravine with his canteen. It was a shallow,\n",
       "grass-green place with aspens growing up everywhere. To his delight\n",
       "he found a tiny brook of swift-running water. Its faint tinge of amber\n",
       "reminded him of the spring at Cottonwoods, and the thought gave him a\n",
       "little shock. The water was so cold it made his fingers tingle as he\n",
       "dipped the canteen. Having returned to the cave, he was glad to see the\n",
       "girl drink thirstily. This time he noted that she could raise her head\n",
       "slightly without his help.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You were thirsty,” he said. “It's good water. I've found a fine place.\n",
       "Tell me--how do you feel?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“There's pain--here,” she replied, and moved her hand to her left side.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why, that's strange! Your wounds are on your right side. I believe\n",
       "you're hungry. Is the pain a kind of dull ache--a gnawing?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's like--that.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Then it's hunger.” Venters laughed, and suddenly caught himself with a\n",
       "quick breath and felt again the little shock. When had he laughed? “It's\n",
       "hunger,” he went on. “I've had that gnaw many a time. I've got it now.\n",
       "But you mustn't eat. You can have all the water you want, but no food\n",
       "just yet.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Won't I--starve?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, people don't starve easily. I've discovered that. You must lie\n",
       "perfectly still and rest and sleep--for days.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“My hands--are dirty; my face feels--so hot and sticky; my boots hurt.”\n",
       " It was her longest speech as yet, and it trailed off in a whisper.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, I'm a fine nurse!”\n",
       "\n",
       "It annoyed him that he had never thought of these things. But then,\n",
       "awaiting her death and thinking of her comfort were vastly different\n",
       "matters. He unwrapped the blanket which covered her. What a slender girl\n",
       "she was! No wonder he had been able to carry her miles and pack her up\n",
       "that slippery ladder of stone. Her boots were of soft, fine leather,\n",
       "reaching clear to her knees. He recognized the make as one of a\n",
       "boot-maker in Sterling. Her spurs, that he had stupidly neglected to\n",
       "remove, consisted of silver frames and gold chains, and the rowels,\n",
       "large as silver dollars, were fancifully engraved. The boots slipped off\n",
       "rather hard. She wore heavy woollen rider's stockings, half length, and\n",
       "these were pulled up over the ends of her short trousers. Venters took\n",
       "off the stockings to note her little feet were red and swollen. He\n",
       "bathed them. Then he removed his scarf and bathed her face and hands.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I must see your wounds now,” he said, gently.\n",
       "\n",
       "She made no reply, but watched him steadily as he opened her blouse and\n",
       "untied the bandage. His strong fingers trembled a little as he removed\n",
       "it. If the wounds had reopened! A chill struck him as he saw the angry\n",
       "red bullet-mark, and a tiny stream of blood winding from it down her\n",
       "white breast. Very carefully he lifted her to see that the wound in her\n",
       "back had closed perfectly. Then he washed the blood from her breast,\n",
       "bathed the wound, and left it unbandaged, open to the air.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her eyes thanked him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Listen,” he said, earnestly. “I've had some wounds, and I've seen many.\n",
       "I know a little about them. The hole in your back has closed. If you lie\n",
       "still three days the one in your breast will close and you'll be safe.\n",
       "The danger from hemorrhage will be over.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He had spoken with earnest sincerity, almost eagerness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why--do you--want me--to get well?” she asked, wonderingly.\n",
       "\n",
       "The simple question seemed unanswerable except on grounds of humanity.\n",
       "But the circumstances under which he had shot this strange girl, the\n",
       "shock and realization, the waiting for death, the hope, had resulted in\n",
       "a condition of mind wherein Venters wanted her to live more than he had\n",
       "ever wanted anything. Yet he could not tell why. He believed the killing\n",
       "of the rustler and the subsequent excitement had disturbed him. For how\n",
       "else could he explain the throbbing of his brain, the heat of his blood,\n",
       "the undefined sense of full hours, charged, vibrant with pulsating\n",
       "mystery where once they had dragged in loneliness?\n",
       "\n",
       "“I shot you,” he said, slowly, “and I want you to get well so I shall\n",
       "not have killed a woman. But--for your own sake, too--”\n",
       "\n",
       "A terrible bitterness darkened her eyes, and her lips quivered.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hush,” said Venters. “You've talked too much already.”\n",
       "\n",
       "In her unutterable bitterness he saw a darkness of mood that could not\n",
       "have been caused by her present weak and feverish state. She hated the\n",
       "life she had led, that she probably had been compelled to lead. She\n",
       "had suffered some unforgivable wrong at the hands of Oldring. With that\n",
       "conviction Venters felt a shame throughout his body, and it marked the\n",
       "rekindling of fierce anger and ruthlessness. In the past long year he\n",
       "had nursed resentment. He had hated the wilderness--the loneliness of\n",
       "the uplands. He had waited for something to come to pass. It had come.\n",
       "Like an Indian stealing horses he had skulked into the recesses of the\n",
       "canyons. He had found Oldring's retreat; he had killed a rustler; he had\n",
       "shot an unfortunate girl, then had saved her from this unwitting act,\n",
       "and he meant to save her from the consequent wasting of blood, from\n",
       "fever and weakness. Starvation he had to fight for her and for himself.\n",
       "Where he had been sick at the letting of blood, now he remembered it in\n",
       "grim, cold calm. And as he lost that softness of nature, so he lost his\n",
       "fear of men. He would watch for Oldring, biding his time, and he would\n",
       "kill this great black-bearded rustler who had held a girl in bondage,\n",
       "who had used her to his infamous ends.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters surmised this much of the change in him--idleness had passed;\n",
       "keen, fierce vigor flooded his mind and body; all that had happened to\n",
       "him at Cottonwoods seemed remote and hard to recall; the difficulties\n",
       "and perils of the present absorbed him, held him in a kind of spell.\n",
       "\n",
       "First, then, he fitted up the little cave adjoining the girl's room\n",
       "for his own comfort and use. His next work was to build a fireplace of\n",
       "stones and to gather a store of wood. That done, he spilled the contents\n",
       "of his saddle-bags upon the grass and took stock. His outfit consisted\n",
       "of a small-handled axe, a hunting-knife, a large number of cartridges\n",
       "for rifle or revolver, a tin plate, a cup, and a fork and spoon,\n",
       "a quantity of dried beef and dried fruits, and small canvas bags\n",
       "containing tea, sugar, salt, and pepper. For him alone this supply would\n",
       "have been bountiful to begin a sojourn in the wilderness, but he was no\n",
       "longer alone. Starvation in the uplands was not an unheard-of thing;\n",
       "he did not, however, worry at all on that score, and feared only his\n",
       "possible inability to supply the needs of a woman in a weakened and\n",
       "extremely delicate condition.\n",
       "\n",
       "If there was no game in the valley--a contingency he doubted--it would\n",
       "not be a great task for him to go by night to Oldring's herd and pack\n",
       "out a calf. The exigency of the moment was to ascertain if there were\n",
       "game in Surprise Valley. Whitie still guarded the dilapidated rabbit,\n",
       "and Ring slept near by under a spruce. Venters called Ring and went to\n",
       "the edge of the terrace, and there halted to survey the valley.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was prepared to find it larger than his unstudied glances had made it\n",
       "appear; for more than a casual idea of dimensions and a hasty conception\n",
       "of oval shape and singular beauty he had not had time. Again the\n",
       "felicity of the name he had given the valley struck him forcibly. Around\n",
       "the red perpendicular walls, except under the great arc of stone, ran\n",
       "a terrace fringed at the cliff-base by silver spruces; below that first\n",
       "terrace sloped another wider one densely overgrown with aspens, and the\n",
       "center of the valley was a level circle of oaks and alders, with the\n",
       "glittering green line of willows and cottonwood dividing it in half.\n",
       "Venters saw a number and variety of birds flitting among the trees.\n",
       "To his left, facing the stone bridge, an enormous cavern opened in the\n",
       "wall; and low down, just above the tree-tops, he made out a long shelf\n",
       "of cliff-dwellings, with little black, staring windows or doors. Like\n",
       "eyes they were, and seemed to watch him. The few cliff-dwellings he had\n",
       "seen--all ruins--had left him with haunting memory of age and solitude\n",
       "and of something past. He had come, in a way, to be a cliff-dweller\n",
       "himself, and those silent eyes would look down upon him, as if in\n",
       "surprise that after thousands of years a man had invaded the valley.\n",
       "Venters felt sure that he was the only white man who had ever walked\n",
       "under the shadow of the wonderful stone bridge, down into that wonderful\n",
       "valley with its circle of caves and its terraced rings of silver spruce\n",
       "and aspens.\n",
       "\n",
       "The dog growled below and rushed into the forest. Venters ran down the\n",
       "declivity to enter a zone of light shade streaked with sunshine. The\n",
       "oak-trees were slender, none more than half a foot thick, and they grew\n",
       "close together, intermingling their branches. Ring came running back\n",
       "with a rabbit in his mouth. Venters took the rabbit and, holding the\n",
       "dog near him, stole softly on. There were fluttering of wings among the\n",
       "branches and quick bird-notes, and rustling of dead leaves and rapid\n",
       "patterings. Venters crossed well-worn trails marked with fresh tracks;\n",
       "and when he had stolen on a little farther he saw many birds and running\n",
       "quail, and more rabbits than he could count. He had not penetrated the\n",
       "forest of oaks for a hundred yards, had not approached anywhere near the\n",
       "line of willows and cottonwoods which he knew grew along a stream. But\n",
       "he had seen enough to know that Surprise Valley was the home of many\n",
       "wild creatures.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters returned to camp. He skinned the rabbits, and gave the dogs the\n",
       "one they had quarreled over, and the skin of this he dressed and hung\n",
       "up to dry, feeling that he would like to keep it. It was a particularly\n",
       "rich, furry pelt with a beautiful white tail. Venters remembered that\n",
       "but for the bobbing of that white tail catching his eye he would not\n",
       "have espied the rabbit, and he would never have discovered Surprise\n",
       "Valley. Little incidents of chance like this had turned him here\n",
       "and there in Deception Pass; and now they had assumed to him the\n",
       "significance and direction of destiny.\n",
       "\n",
       "His good fortune in the matter of game at hand brought to his mind the\n",
       "necessity of keeping it in the valley. Therefore he took the axe and cut\n",
       "bundles of aspens and willows, and packed them up under the bridge to\n",
       "the narrow outlet of the gorge. Here he began fashioning a fence, by\n",
       "driving aspens into the ground and lacing them fast with willows. Trip\n",
       "after trip he made down for more building material, and the afternoon\n",
       "had passed when he finished the work to his satisfaction. Wildcats might\n",
       "scale the fence, but no coyote could come in to search for prey, and no\n",
       "rabbits or other small game could escape from the valley.\n",
       "\n",
       "Upon returning to camp he set about getting his supper at ease, around a\n",
       "fine fire, without hurry or fear of discovery. After hard work that\n",
       "had definite purpose, this freedom and comfort gave him peculiar\n",
       "satisfaction. He caught himself often, as he kept busy round the\n",
       "camp-fire, stopping to glance at the quiet form in the cave, and at\n",
       "the dogs stretched cozily near him, and then out across the beautiful\n",
       "valley. The present was not yet real to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "While he ate, the sun set beyond a dip in the rim of the curved wall. As\n",
       "the morning sun burst wondrously through a grand arch into this valley,\n",
       "in a golden, slanting shaft, so the evening sun, at the moment of\n",
       "setting, shone through a gap of cliffs, sending down a broad red burst\n",
       "to brighten the oval with a blaze of fire. To Venters both sunrise and\n",
       "sunset were unreal.\n",
       "\n",
       "A cool wind blew across the oval, waving the tips of oaks, and while\n",
       "the light lasted, fluttering the aspen leaves into millions of facets of\n",
       "red, and sweeping the graceful spruces. Then with the wind soon came\n",
       "a shade and a darkening, and suddenly the valley was gray. Night came\n",
       "there quickly after the sinking of the sun. Venters went softly to look\n",
       "at the girl. She slept, and her breathing was quiet and slow. He lifted\n",
       "Ring into the cave, with stern whisper for him to stay there on\n",
       "guard. Then he drew the blanket carefully over her and returned to the\n",
       "camp-fire.\n",
       "\n",
       "Though exceedingly tired, he was yet loath to yield to lassitude, but\n",
       "this night it was not from listening, watchful vigilance; it was from\n",
       "a desire to realize his position. The details of his wild environment\n",
       "seemed the only substance of a strange dream. He saw the darkening rims,\n",
       "the gray oval turning black, the undulating surface of forest, like a\n",
       "rippling lake, and the spear-pointed spruces. He heard the flutter\n",
       "of aspen leaves and the soft, continuous splash of falling water. The\n",
       "melancholy note of a canyon bird broke clear and lonely from the high\n",
       "cliffs. Venters had no name for this night singer, and he had never seen\n",
       "one, but the few notes, always pealing out just at darkness, were as\n",
       "familiar to him as the canyon silence. Then they ceased, and the rustle\n",
       "of leaves and the murmur of water hushed in a growing sound that Venters\n",
       "fancied was not of earth. Neither had he a name for this, only it was\n",
       "inexpressibly wild and sweet. The thought came that it might be a moan\n",
       "of the girl in her last outcry of life, and he felt a tremor shake him.\n",
       "But no! This sound was not human, though it was like despair. He began\n",
       "to doubt his sensitive perceptions, to believe that he half-dreamed what\n",
       "he thought he heard. Then the sound swelled with the strengthening\n",
       "of the breeze, and he realized it was the singing of the wind in the\n",
       "cliffs.\n",
       "\n",
       "By and by a drowsiness overcame him, and Venters began to nod, half\n",
       "asleep, with his back against a spruce. Rousing himself and calling\n",
       "Whitie, he went to the cave. The girl lay barely visible in the dimness.\n",
       "Ring crouched beside her, and the patting of his tail on the stone\n",
       "assured Venters that the dog was awake and faithful to his duty. Venters\n",
       "sought his own bed of fragrant boughs; and as he lay back, somehow\n",
       "grateful for the comfort and safety, the night seemed to steal away from\n",
       "him and he sank softly into intangible space and rest and slumber.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters awakened to the sound of melody that he imagined was only the\n",
       "haunting echo of dream music. He opened his eyes to another surprise\n",
       "of this valley of beautiful surprises. Out of his cave he saw the\n",
       "exquisitely fine foliage of the silver spruces crossing a round space\n",
       "of blue morning sky; and in this lacy leafage fluttered a number of\n",
       "gray birds with black and white stripes and long tails. They were\n",
       "mocking-birds, and they were singing as if they wanted to burst their\n",
       "throats. Venters listened. One long, silver-tipped branch dropped almost\n",
       "to his cave, and upon it, within a few yards of him, sat one of the\n",
       "graceful birds. Venters saw the swelling and quivering of its throat\n",
       "in song. He arose, and when he slid down out of his cave the birds\n",
       "fluttered and flew farther away.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters stepped before the opening of the other cave and looked in. The\n",
       "girl was awake, with wide eyes and listening look, and she had a hand on\n",
       "Ring's neck.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Mocking-birds!” she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes,” replied Venters, “and I believe they like our company.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Where are we?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Never mind now. After a little I'll tell you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“The birds woke me. When I heard them--and saw the shiny trees--and the\n",
       "blue sky--and then a blaze of gold dropping down--I wondered--”\n",
       "\n",
       "She did not complete her fancy, but Venters imagined he understood her\n",
       "meaning. She appeared to be wandering in mind. Venters felt her face and\n",
       "hands and found them burning with fever. He went for water, and was glad\n",
       "to find it almost as cold as if flowing from ice. That water was the\n",
       "only medicine he had, and he put faith in it. She did not want to drink,\n",
       "but he made her swallow, and then he bathed her face and head and cooled\n",
       "her wrists.\n",
       "\n",
       "The day began with the heightening of the fever. Venters spent the time\n",
       "reducing her temperature, cooling her hot cheeks and temples. He kept\n",
       "close watch over her, and at the least indication of restlessness, that\n",
       "he knew led to tossing and rolling of the body, he held her tightly, so\n",
       "no violent move could reopen her wounds. Hour after hour she babbled and\n",
       "laughed and cried and moaned in delirium; but whatever her secret was\n",
       "she did not reveal it. Attended by something somber for Venters, the day\n",
       "passed. At night in the cool winds the fever abated and she slept.\n",
       "\n",
       "The second day was a repetition of the first. On the third he seemed to\n",
       "see her wither and waste away before his eyes. That day he scarcely went\n",
       "from her side for a moment, except to run for fresh, cool water; and he\n",
       "did not eat. The fever broke on the fourth day and left her spent and\n",
       "shrunken, a slip of a girl with life only in her eyes. They hung upon\n",
       "Venters with a mute observance, and he found hope in that.\n",
       "\n",
       "To rekindle the spark that had nearly flickered out, to nourish the\n",
       "little life and vitality that remained in her, was Venters's problem.\n",
       "But he had little resource other than the meat of the rabbits and quail;\n",
       "and from these he made broths and soups as best he could, and fed her\n",
       "with a spoon. It came to him that the human body, like the human soul,\n",
       "was a strange thing and capable of recovering from terrible shocks. For\n",
       "almost immediately she showed faint signs of gathering strength. There\n",
       "was one more waiting day, in which he doubted, and spent long hours by\n",
       "her side as she slept, and watched the gentle swell of her breast rise\n",
       "and fall in breathing, and the wind stir the tangled chestnut curls. On\n",
       "the next day he knew that she would live.\n",
       "\n",
       "Upon realizing it he abruptly left the cave and sought his accustomed\n",
       "seat against the trunk of a big spruce, where once more he let his\n",
       "glance stray along the sloping terraces. She would live, and the somber\n",
       "gloom lifted out of the valley, and he felt relief that was pain. Then\n",
       "he roused to the call of action, to the many things he needed to do\n",
       "in the way of making camp fixtures and utensils, to the necessity of\n",
       "hunting food, and the desire to explore the valley.\n",
       "\n",
       "But he decided to wait a few more days before going far from camp,\n",
       "because he fancied that the girl rested easier when she could see him\n",
       "near at hand. And on the first day her languor appeared to leave her in\n",
       "a renewed grip of life. She awoke stronger from each short slumber; she\n",
       "ate greedily, and she moved about in her bed of boughs; and always, it\n",
       "seemed to Venters, her eyes followed him. He knew now that her recovery\n",
       "would be rapid. She talked about the dogs, about the caves, the valley,\n",
       "about how hungry she was, till Venters silenced her, asking her to put\n",
       "off further talk till another time. She obeyed, but she sat up in her\n",
       "bed, and her eyes roved to and fro, and always back to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Upon the second morning she sat up when he awakened her, and would not\n",
       "permit him to bathe her face and feed her, which actions she performed\n",
       "for herself. She spoke little, however, and Venters was quick to\n",
       "catch in her the first intimations of thoughtfulness and curiosity and\n",
       "appreciation of her situation. He left camp and took Whitie out to\n",
       "hunt for rabbits. Upon his return he was amazed and somewhat anxiously\n",
       "concerned to see his invalid sitting with her back to a corner of the\n",
       "cave and her bare feet swinging out. Hurriedly he approached, intending\n",
       "to advise her to lie down again, to tell her that perhaps she might\n",
       "overtax her strength. The sun shone upon her, glinting on the little\n",
       "head with its tangle of bright hair and the small, oval face with its\n",
       "pallor, and dark-blue eyes underlined by dark-blue circles. She looked\n",
       "at him and he looked at her. In that exchange of glances he imagined\n",
       "each saw the other in some different guise. It seemed impossible to\n",
       "Venters that this frail girl could be Oldring's Masked Rider. It flashed\n",
       "over him that he had made a mistake which presently she would explain.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Help me down,” she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "“But--are you well enough?” he protested. “Wait--a little longer.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm weak--dizzy. But I want to get down.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He lifted her--what a light burden now!--and stood her upright beside\n",
       "him, and supported her as she essayed to walk with halting steps. She\n",
       "was like a stripling of a boy; the bright, small head scarcely reached\n",
       "his shoulder. But now, as she clung to his arm, the rider's costume she\n",
       "wore did not contradict, as it had done at first, his feeling of her\n",
       "femininity. She might be the famous Masked Rider of the uplands, she\n",
       "might resemble a boy; but her outline, her little hands and feet, her\n",
       "hair, her big eyes and tremulous lips, and especially a something that\n",
       "Venters felt as a subtle essence rather than what he saw, proclaimed her\n",
       "sex.\n",
       "\n",
       "She soon tired. He arranged a comfortable seat for her under the spruce\n",
       "that overspread the camp-fire.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Now tell me--everything,” she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "He recounted all that had happened from the time of his discovery of the\n",
       "rustlers in the canyon up to the present moment.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You shot me--and now you've saved my life?”\n",
       "\n",

       "Her eyes were unusually expressive, and they regarded him steadily; she\n",
       "was unconscious of that mirroring of her emotions and they shone with\n",
       "gratefulness and interest and wonder and sadness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Tell me--about yourself?” she asked.\n",
       "\n",
       "He made this a briefer story, telling of his coming to Utah, his\n",
       "various occupations till he became a rider, and then how the Mormons had\n",
       "practically driven him out of Cottonwoods, an outcast.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, no longer able to withstand his own burning curiosity, he\n",
       "questioned her in turn.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Are you Oldring's Masked Rider?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes,” she replied, and dropped her eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I knew it--I recognized your figure--and mask, for I saw you once.\n",
       "Yet I can't believe it!... But you never were really that rustler, as we\n",
       "riders knew him? A thief--a marauder--a kidnapper of women--a murderer\n",
       "of sleeping riders!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No! I never stole--or harmed any one--in all my life. I only rode and\n",

       "“But why--why?” he burst out. “Why the name? I understand Oldring made\n",
       "you ride. But the black mask--the mystery--the things laid to your\n",
       "hands--the threats in your infamous name--the night-riding credited\n",
       "to you--the evil deeds deliberately blamed on you and acknowledged by\n",
       "rustlers--even Oldring himself! Why? Tell me why?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I never knew that,” she answered low. Her drooping head straightened,\n",
       "and the large eyes, larger now and darker, met Venters's with a clear,\n",
       "steadfast gaze in which he read truth. It verified his own conviction.\n",

       "\n",
       "Venters paused in his rapid-fire questioning, as if to brace him self to\n",
       "ask for a truth that would be abhorrent for him to confirm, but which he\n",
       "seemed driven to hear.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What are--what were you to Oldring?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Like some delicate thing suddenly exposed to blasting heat, the girl\n",

       "red of shame.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters would have given anything to recall that question. It seemed\n",
       "so different--his thought when spoken. Yet her shame established in his\n",

       "feel for her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“D--n that question!--forget it!” he cried, in a passion of pain for her\n",

       "want to help you--not hurt you. I thought life had been cruel to me, but\n",
       "when I think of yours I feel mean and little for my complaining. Anyway,\n",
       "I was a lonely outcast. And now!... I don't see very clearly what it all\n",
       "means. Only we are here--together. We've got to stay here, for long,\n",
       "surely till you are well. But you'll never go back to Oldring. And I'm\n",
       "sure helping you will help me, for I was sick in mind. There's something\n",
       "now for me to do. And if I can win back your strength--then get you\n",

       "CHAPTER X. LOVE\n",
       "\n",
       "During all these waiting days Venters, with the exception of the\n",
       "afternoon when he had built the gate in the gorge, had scarcely gone\n",
       "out of sight of camp and never out of hearing. His desire to explore\n",
       "Surprise Valley was keen, and on the morning after his long talk with\n",
       "the girl he took his rifle and, calling Ring, made a move to start. The\n",
       "girl lay back in a rude chair of boughs he had put together for her. She\n",
       "had been watching him, and when he picked up the gun and called the dog\n",
       "Venters thought she gave a nervous start.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm only going to look over the valley,” he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Will you be gone long?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No,” he replied, and started off. The incident set him thinking of his\n",
       "former impression that, after her recovery from fever, she did not seem\n",
       "at ease unless he was close at hand. It was fear of being alone, due, he\n",
       "concluded, most likely to her weakened condition. He must not leave her\n",
       "much alone.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he strode down the sloping terrace, rabbits scampered before him,\n",
       "and the beautiful valley quail, as purple in color as the sage on the\n",
       "uplands, ran fleetly along the ground into the forest. It was pleasant\n",
       "under the trees, in the gold-flecked shade, with the whistle of quail\n",
       "and twittering of birds everywhere. Soon he had passed the limit of his\n",
       "former excursions and entered new territory. Here the woods began to\n",
       "show open glades and brooks running down from the slope, and presently\n",
       "he emerged from shade into the sunshine of a meadow. The shaking of the\n",
       "high grass told him of the running of animals, what species he could\n",
       "not tell, but from Ring's manifest desire to have a chase they were\n",
       "evidently some kind wilder than rabbits. Venters approached the willow\n",
       "and cottonwood belt that he had observed from the height of slope.\n",
       "He penetrated it to find a considerable stream of water and great\n",
       "half-submerged mounds of brush and sticks, and all about him were old\n",
       "and new gnawed circles at the base of the cottonwoods.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Beaver!” he exclaimed. “By all that's lucky! The meadow's full of\n",
       "beaver! How did they ever get here?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Beaver had not found a way into the valley by the trail of the\n",
       "cliff-dwellers, of that he was certain; and he began to have more than\n",
       "curiosity as to the outlet or inlet of the stream. When he passed some\n",
       "dead water, which he noted was held by a beaver dam, there was a current\n",
       "in the stream, and it flowed west. Following its course, he soon entered\n",
       "the oak forest again, and passed through to find himself before massed\n",
       "and jumbled ruins of cliff wall. There were tangled thickets of\n",
       "wild plum-trees and other thorny growths that made passage extremely\n",
       "laborsome. He found innumerable tracks of wildcats and foxes. Rustlings\n",
       "in the thick undergrowth told him of stealthy movements of these\n",
       "animals. At length his further advance appeared futile, for the reason\n",
       "that the stream disappeared in a split at the base of immense rocks over\n",
       "which he could not climb. To his relief he concluded that though beaver\n",
       "might work their way up the narrow chasm where the water rushed, it\n",
       "would be impossible for men to enter the valley there.\n",
       "\n",
       "This western curve was the only part of the valley where the walls had\n",
       "been split asunder, and it was a wildly rough and inaccessible corner.\n",
       "Going back a little way, he leaped the stream and headed toward the\n",
       "southern wall. Once out of the oaks he found again the low terrace of\n",
       "aspens, and above that the wide, open terrace fringed by silver spruces.\n",
       "This side of the valley contained the wind or water worn caves. As he\n",
       "pressed on, keeping to the upper terrace, cave after cave opened out of\n",
       "the cliff; now a large one, now a small one. Then yawned, quite suddenly\n",
       "and wonderfully above him, the great cavern of the cliff-dwellers.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was still a goodly distance, and he tried to imagine, if it appeared\n",
       "so huge from where he stood, what it would be when he got there. He\n",
       "climbed the terrace and then faced a long, gradual ascent of weathered\n",
       "rock and dust, which made climbing too difficult for attention to\n",
       "anything else. At length he entered a zone of shade, and looked up.\n",
       "He stood just within the hollow of a cavern so immense that he had no\n",
       "conception of its real dimensions. The curved roof, stained by ages\n",
       "of leakage, with buff and black and rust-colored streaks, swept up and\n",
       "loomed higher and seemed to soar to the rim of the cliff. Here again was\n",
       "a magnificent arch, such as formed the grand gateway to the valley, only\n",
       "in this instance it formed the dome of a cave instead of the span of a\n",
       "bridge.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters passed onward and upward. The stones he dislodged rolled down\n",
       "with strange, hollow crack and roar. He had climbed a hundred rods\n",
       "inward, and yet he had not reached the base of the shelf where the\n",
       "cliff-dwellings rested, a long half-circle of connected stone house,\n",
       "with little dark holes that he had fancied were eyes. At length he\n",
       "gained the base of the shelf, and here found steps cut in the rock.\n",
       "These facilitated climbing, and as he went up he thought how easily this\n",
       "vanished race of men might once have held that stronghold against an\n",
       "army. There was only one possible place to ascend, and this was narrow\n",
       "and steep.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters had visited cliff-dwellings before, and they had been in ruins,\n",
       "and of no great character or size but this place was of proportions that\n",
       "stunned him, and it had not been desecrated by the hand of man, nor had\n",
       "it been crumbled by the hand of time. It was a stupendous tomb. It had\n",
       "been a city. It was just as it had been left by its builders. The little\n",
       "houses were there, the smoke-blackened stains of fires, the pieces of\n",
       "pottery scattered about cold hearths, the stone hatchets; and stone\n",
       "pestles and mealing-stones lay beside round holes polished by years\n",
       "of grinding maize--lay there as if they had been carelessly dropped\n",
       "yesterday. But the cliff-dwellers were gone!\n",
       "\n",
       "Dust! They were dust on the floor or at the foot of the shelf, and their\n",
       "habitations and utensils endured. Venters felt the sublimity of that\n",
       "marvelous vaulted arch, and it seemed to gleam with a glory of something\n",
       "that was gone. How many years had passed since the cliff-dwellers gazed\n",
       "out across the beautiful valley as he was gazing now? How long had it\n",
       "been since women ground grain in those polished holes? What time had\n",
       "rolled by since men of an unknown race lived, loved, fought, and died\n",
       "there? Had an enemy destroyed them? Had disease destroyed them, or only\n",
       "that greatest destroyer--time? Venters saw a long line of blood-red\n",
       "hands painted low down upon the yellow roof of stone. Here was strange\n",
       "portent, if not an answer to his queries. The place oppressed him. It\n",
       "was light, but full of a transparent gloom. It smelled of dust and musty\n",
       "stone, of age and disuse. It was sad. It was solemn. It had the look\n",
       "of a place where silence had become master and was now irrevocable and\n",
       "terrible and could not be broken. Yet, at the moment, from high up in\n",
       "the carved crevices of the arch, floated down the low, strange wail of\n",
       "wind--a knell indeed for all that had gone.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters, sighing, gathered up an armful of pottery, such pieces as he\n",
       "thought strong enough and suitable for his own use, and bent his steps\n",
       "toward camp. He mounted the terrace at an opposite point to which he\n",
       "had left. He saw the girl looking in the direction he had gone. His\n",
       "footsteps made no sound in the deep grass, and he approached close\n",
       "without her being aware of his presence. Whitie lay on the ground near\n",
       "where she sat, and he manifested the usual actions of welcome, but the\n",
       "girl did not notice them. She seemed to be oblivious to everything near\n",
       "at hand. She made a pathetic figure drooping there, with her sunny hair\n",
       "contrasting so markedly with her white, wasted cheeks and her hands\n",
       "listlessly clasped and her little bare feet propped in the framework of\n",
       "the rude seat. Venters could have sworn and laughed in one breath at the\n",
       "idea of the connection between this girl and Oldring's Masked Rider. She\n",
       "was the victim of more than accident of fate--a victim to some deep\n",
       "plot the mystery of which burned him. As he stepped forward with a\n",
       "half-formed thought that she was absorbed in watching for his return,\n",
       "she turned her head and saw him. A swift start, a change rather than\n",
       "rush of blood under her white cheeks, a flashing of big eyes that fixed\n",
       "their glance upon him, transformed her face in that single instant of\n",
       "turning, and he knew she had been watching for him, that his return was\n",
       "the one thing in her mind. She did not smile; she did not flush; she\n",
       "did not look glad. All these would have meant little compared to her\n",
       "indefinite expression. Venters grasped the peculiar, vivid, vital\n",
       "something that leaped from her face. It was as if she had been in a\n",
       "dead, hopeless clamp of inaction and feeling, and had been suddenly shot\n",
       "through and through with quivering animation. Almost it was as if she\n",
       "had returned to life.\n",
       "\n",
       "And Venters thought with lightning swiftness, “I've saved her--I've\n",
       "unlinked her from that old life--she was watching as if I were all she\n",
       "had left on earth--she belongs to me!” The thought was startlingly new.\n",
       "Like a blow it was in an unprepared moment. The cheery salutation he had\n",
       "ready for her died unborn and he tumbled the pieces of pottery awkwardly\n",
       "on the grass while some unfamiliar, deep-seated emotion, mixed with pity\n",
       "and glad assurance of his power to succor her, held him dumb.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What a load you had!” she said. “Why, they're pots and crocks! Where\n",
       "did you get them?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters laid down his rifle, and, filling one of the pots from his\n",
       "canteen, he placed it on the smoldering campfire.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hope it'll hold water,” he said, presently. “Why, there's an enormous\n",
       "cliff-dwelling just across here. I got the pottery there. Don't you\n",
       "think we needed something? That tin cup of mine has served to make tea,\n",
       "broth, soup--everything.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I noticed we hadn't a great deal to cook in.”\n",
       "\n",
       "She laughed. It was the first time. He liked that laugh, and though he\n",
       "was tempted to look at her, he did not want to show his surprise or his\n",
       "pleasure.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Will you take me over there, and all around in the valley--pretty soon,\n",
       "when I'm well?” she added.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Indeed I shall. It's a wonderful place. Rabbits so thick you can't step\n",
       "without kicking one out. And quail, beaver, foxes, wildcats. We're in a\n",
       "regular den. But--haven't you ever seen a cliff-dwelling?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No. I've heard about them, though. The--the men say the Pass is full of\n",

       "\n",
       "“Why, I should think you'd have run across one in all your riding\n",
       "around,” said Venters. He spoke slowly, choosing his words carefully,\n",
       "and he essayed a perfectly casual manner, and pretended to be busy\n",
       "assorting pieces of pottery. She must have no cause again to suffer\n",
       "shame for curiosity of his. Yet never in all his days had he been so\n",
       "eager to hear the details of anyone's life.\n",

       "\n",
       "“When Oldring went away on his long trips--he was gone for months\n",

       "\n",
       "“What for?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Perhaps to keep me from running away. I always threatened that. Mostly,\n",
       "though, because the men got drunk at the villages. But they were always\n",
       "good to me. I wasn't afraid.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“A prisoner! That must have been hard on you?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I liked that. As long as I can remember I've been locked up there at\n",
       "times, and those times were the only happy ones I ever had. It's a big\n",
       "cabin, high up on a cliff, and I could look out. Then I had dogs and\n",
       "pets I had tamed, and books. There was a spring inside, and food stored,\n",
       "and the men brought me fresh meat. Once I was there one whole winter.”\n",
       "\n",
       "It now required deliberation on Venters's part to persist in his\n",
       "unconcern and to keep at work. He wanted to look at her, to volley\n",
       "questions at her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“As long as you can remember--you've lived in Deception Pass?” he went\n",
       "on.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I've a dim memory of some other place, and women and children; but I\n",
       "can't make anything of it. Sometimes I think till I'm weary.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Then you can read--you have books?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh yes, I can read, and write, too, pretty well. Oldring is educated.\n",
       "He taught me, and years ago an old rustler lived with us, and he had\n",
       "been something different once. He was always teaching me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“So Oldring takes long trips,” mused Venters. “Do you know where he\n",
       "goes?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No. Every year he drives cattle north of Sterling--then does not return\n",

       "\n",
       "“You're right. He's more than a rustler. In fact, as the men say, his\n",

       "“Ah!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes, there's gold, not in great quantities, but gold enough for him and\n",
       "his men. They wash for gold week in and week out. Then they drive a few\n",

       "\n",
       "“Drive a few cattle! But, Bess, the Withersteen herd, the red\n",

       "into a valley near here.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oldring never stole the red herd. He made a deal with Mormons. The\n",

       "Oldring's men tell about Mormons. Maybe the Withersteen woman wasn't\n",
       "minding her halter! I saw the man who made the deal. He was a little,\n",
       "queer-shaped man, all humped up. He sat his horse well. I heard one of\n",

       "fellow. What was the name? I forget.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jerry Card?” suggested Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That's it. I remember--it's a name easy to remember--and Jerry Card\n",
       "appeared to be on fair terms with Oldring's men.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I shouldn't wonder,” replied Venters, thoughtfully. Verification of his\n",
       "suspicions in regard to Tull's underhand work--for the deal with Oldring\n",
       "made by Jerry Card assuredly had its inception in the Mormon Elder's\n",
       "brain, and had been accomplished through his orders--revived in Venters\n",
       "a memory of hatred that had been smothered by press of other emotions.\n",
       "Only a few days had elapsed since the hour of his encounter with Tull,\n",
       "yet they had been forgotten and now seemed far off, and the interval\n",
       "one that now appeared large and profound with incalculable change in his\n",
       "feelings. Hatred of Tull still existed in his heart, but it had lost its\n",
       "white heat. His affection for Jane Withersteen had not changed in the\n",
       "least; nevertheless, he seemed to view it from another angle and see it\n",
       "as another thing--what, he could not exactly define. The recalling of\n",
       "these two feelings was to Venters like getting glimpses into a self\n",
       "that was gone; and the wonder of them--perhaps the change which was too\n",
       "illusive for him--was the fact that a strange irritation accompanied\n",
       "the memory and a desire to dismiss it from mind. And straightway he did\n",
       "dismiss it, to return to thoughts of his significant present.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess, tell me one more thing,” he said. “Haven't you known any\n",
       "women--any young people?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sometimes there were women with the men; but Oldring never let me know\n",
       "them. And all the young people I ever saw in my life was when I rode\n",
       "fast through the villages.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Perhaps that was the most puzzling and thought-provoking thing she had\n",
       "yet said to Venters. He pondered, more curious the more he learned, but\n",
       "he curbed his inquisitive desires, for he saw her shrinking on the\n",
       "verge of that shame, the causing of which had occasioned him such\n",
       "self-reproach. He would ask no more. Still he had to think, and he\n",
       "found it difficult to think clearly. This sad-eyed girl was so utterly\n",
       "different from what it would have been reason to believe such a\n",
       "remarkable life would have made her. On this day he had found her simple\n",
       "and frank, as natural as any girl he had ever known. About her there was\n",
       "something sweet. Her voice was low and well modulated. He could not look\n",
       "into her face, meet her steady, unabashed, yet wistful eyes, and think\n",
       "of her as the woman she had confessed herself. Oldring's Masked Rider\n",
       "sat before him, a girl dressed as a man. She had been made to ride at\n",
       "the head of infamous forays and drives. She had been imprisoned for many\n",
       "months of her life in an obscure cabin. At times the most vicious of men\n",
       "had been her companions; and the vilest of women, if they had not been\n",
       "permitted to approach her, had, at least, cast their shadows over her.\n",
       "But--but in spite of all this--there thundered at Venters some truth\n",
       "that lifted its voice higher than the clamoring facts of dishonor,\n",
       "some truth that was the very life of her beautiful eyes; and it was\n",
       "innocence.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the days that followed, Venters balanced perpetually in mind this\n",
       "haunting conception of innocence over against the cold and sickening\n",
       "fact of an unintentional yet actual gift. How could it be possible for\n",
       "the two things to be true? He believed the latter to be true, and he\n",
       "would not relinquish his conviction of the former; and these conflicting\n",
       "thoughts augmented the mystery that appeared to be a part of Bess. In\n",
       "those ensuing days, however, it became clear as clearest light that\n",
       "Bess was rapidly regaining strength; that, unless reminded of her long\n",
       "association with Oldring, she seemed to have forgotten it; that, like an\n",
       "Indian who lives solely from moment to moment, she was utterly absorbed\n",
       "in the present.\n",
       "\n",
       "Day by day Venters watched the white of her face slowly change to brown,\n",
       "and the wasted cheeks fill out by imperceptible degrees. There came a\n",
       "time when he could just trace the line of demarcation between the part\n",
       "of her face once hidden by a mask and that left exposed to wind and sun.\n",
       "When that line disappeared in clear bronze tan it was as if she had been\n",
       "washed clean of the stigma of Oldring's Masked Rider. The suggestion of\n",
       "the mask always made Venters remember; now that it was gone he seldom\n",
       "thought of her past. Occasionally he tried to piece together the several\n",
       "stages of strange experience and to make a whole. He had shot a masked\n",
       "outlaw the very sight of whom had been ill omen to riders; he had\n",
       "carried off a wounded woman whose bloody lips quivered in prayer; he\n",
       "had nursed what seemed a frail, shrunken boy; and now he watched a girl\n",
       "whose face had become strangely sweet, whose dark-blue eyes were ever\n",
       "upon him without boldness, without shyness, but with a steady, grave,\n",
       "and growing light. Many times Venters found the clear gaze embarrassing\n",
       "to him, yet, like wine, it had an exhilarating effect. What did she\n",
       "think when she looked at him so? Almost he believed she had no thought\n",
       "at all. All about her and the present there in Surprise Valley, and\n",
       "the dim yet subtly impending future, fascinated Venters and made him\n",
       "thoughtful as all his lonely vigils in the sage had not.\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiefly it was the present that he wished to dwell upon; but it was the\n",
       "call of the future which stirred him to action. No idea had he of\n",
       "what that future had in store for Bess and him. He began to think\n",
       "of improving Surprise Valley as a place to live in, for there was\n",
       "no telling how long they would be compelled to stay there. Venters\n",
       "stubbornly resisted the entering into his mind of an insistent thought\n",
       "that, clearly realized, might have made it plain to him that he did\n",
       "not want to leave Surprise Valley at all. But it was imperative that he\n",
       "consider practical matters; and whether or not he was destined to stay\n",
       "long there, he felt the immediate need of a change of diet. It would be\n",
       "necessary for him to go farther afield for a variety of meat, and also\n",
       "that he soon visit Cottonwoods for a supply of food.\n",
       "\n",
       "It occurred again to Venters that he could go to the canyon where\n",
       "Oldring kept his cattle, and at little risk he could pack out some beef.\n",
       "He wished to do this, however, without letting Bess know of it till\n",
       "after he had made the trip. Presently he hit upon the plan of going\n",
       "while she was asleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "That very night he stole out of camp, climbed up under the stone bridge,\n",
       "and entered the outlet to the Pass. The gorge was full of luminous\n",
       "gloom. Balancing Rock loomed dark and leaned over the pale descent.\n",
       "Transformed in the shadowy light, it took shape and dimensions of a\n",
       "spectral god waiting--waiting for the moment to hurl himself down upon\n",
       "the tottering walls and close forever the outlet to Deception Pass. At\n",
       "night more than by day Venters felt something fearful and fateful in\n",
       "that rock, and that it had leaned and waited through a thousand years to\n",
       "have somehow to deal with his destiny.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Old man, if you must roll, wait till I get back to the girl, and then\n",
       "roll!” he said, aloud, as if the stones were indeed a god.\n",
       "\n",
       "And those spoken words, in their grim note to his ear, as well as\n",
       "contents to his mind, told Venters that he was all but drifting on a\n",
       "current which he had not power nor wish to stem.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters exercised his usual care in the matter of hiding tracks from the\n",
       "outlet, yet it took him scarcely an hour to reach Oldring's cattle.\n",
       "Here sight of many calves changed his original intention, and instead\n",
       "of packing out meat he decided to take a calf out alive. He roped one,\n",
       "securely tied its feet, and swung it over his shoulder. Here was an\n",
       "exceedingly heavy burden, but Venters was powerful--he could take up\n",
       "a sack of grain and with ease pitch it over a pack-saddle--and he made\n",
       "long distance without resting. The hardest work came in the climb up to\n",
       "the outlet and on through to the valley. When he had accomplished it,\n",
       "he became fired with another idea that again changed his intention.\n",
       "He would not kill the calf, but keep it alive. He would go back to\n",
       "Oldring's herd and pack out more calves. Thereupon he secured the calf\n",
       "in the best available spot for the moment and turned to make a second\n",
       "trip.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Venters got back to the valley with another calf, it was close upon\n",
       "daybreak. He crawled into his cave and slept late. Bess had no inkling\n",
       "that he had been absent from camp nearly all night, and only remarked\n",
       "solicitously that he appeared to be more tired than usual, and more in\n",
       "the need of sleep. In the afternoon Venters built a gate across a small\n",
       "ravine near camp, and here corralled the calves; and he succeeded in\n",
       "completing his task without Bess being any the wiser.\n",
       "\n",
       "That night he made two more trips to Oldring's range, and again on the\n",
       "following night, and yet another on the next. With eight calves in his\n",
       "corral, he concluded that he had enough; but it dawned upon him then\n",
       "that he did not want to kill one. “I've rustled Oldring's cattle,” he\n",
       "said, and laughed. He noted then that all the calves were red. “Red!”\n",
       " he exclaimed. “From the red herd. I've stolen Jane Withersteen's\n",
       "cattle!... That's about the strangest thing yet.”\n",
       "\n",
       "One more trip he undertook to Oldring's valley, and this time he roped\n",
       "a yearling steer and killed it and cut out a small quarter of beef. The\n",
       "howling of coyotes told him he need have no apprehension that the work\n",
       "of his knife would be discovered. He packed the beef back to camp and\n",
       "hung it upon a spruce-tree. Then he sought his bed.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the morrow he was up bright and early, glad that he had a surprise\n",
       "for Bess. He could hardly wait for her to come out. Presently she\n",
       "appeared and walked under the spruce. Then she approached the camp-fire.\n",
       "There was a tinge of healthy red in the bronze of her cheeks, and her\n",
       "slender form had begun to round out in graceful lines.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess, didn't you say you were tired of rabbit?” inquired Venters. “And\n",
       "quail and beaver?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Indeed I did.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What would you like?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm tired of meat, but if we have to live on it I'd like some beef.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, how does that strike you?” Venters pointed to the quarter hanging\n",
       "from the spruce-tree. “We'll have fresh beef for a few days, then we'll\n",
       "cut the rest into strips and dry it.”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "At Jane Withersteen's home the promise made to Mrs. Larkin to care for\n",
       "little Fay had begun to be fulfilled. Like a gleam of sunlight through\n",
       "the cottonwoods was the coming of the child to the gloomy house of\n",
       "Withersteen. The big, silent halls echoed with childish laughter. In the\n",
       "shady court, where Jane spent many of the hot July days, Fay's tiny\n",
       "feet pattered over the stone flags and splashed in the amber stream. She\n",
       "prattled incessantly. What difference, Jane thought, a child made in her\n",
       "home! It had never been a real home, she discovered. Even the tidiness\n",
       "and neatness she had so observed, and upon which she had insisted to her\n",
       "women, became, in the light of Fay's smile, habits that now lost their\n",
       "importance. Fay littered the court with Jane's books and papers, and\n",
       "other toys her fancy improvised, and many a strange craft went floating\n",
       "down the little brook.\n",
       "\n",
       "And it was owing to Fay's presence that Jane Withersteen came to see\n",
       "more of Lassiter. The rider had for the most part kept to the sage. He\n",
       "rode for her, but he did not seek her except on business; and Jane had\n",
       "to acknowledge in pique that her overtures had been made in vain. Fay,\n",
       "however, captured Lassiter the moment he first laid eyes on her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane was present at the meeting, and there was something about it which\n",
       "dimmed her sight and softened her toward this foe of her people. The\n",
       "rider had clanked into the court, a tired yet wary man, always looking\n",
       "for the attack upon him that was inevitable and might come from any\n",
       "quarter; and he had walked right upon little Fay. The child had been\n",
       "beautiful even in her rags and amid the surroundings of the hovel in the\n",
       "sage, but now, in a pretty white dress, with her shining curls brushed\n",
       "and her face clean and rosy, she was lovely. She left her play and\n",
       "looked up at Lassiter.\n",
       "\n",
       "If there was not an instinct for all three of them in that meeting, an\n",
       "unreasoning tendency toward a closer intimacy, then Jane Withersteen\n",
       "believed she had been subject to a queer fancy. She imagined any child\n",
       "would have feared Lassiter. And Fay Larkin had been a lonely, a solitary\n",
       "elf of the sage, not at all an ordinary child, and exquisitely shy\n",
       "with strangers. She watched Lassiter with great, round, grave eyes, but\n",
       "showed no fear. The rider gave Jane a favorable report of cattle and\n",
       "horses; and as he took the seat to which she invited him, little Fay\n",
       "edged as much as half an inch nearer. Jane replied to his look of\n",
       "inquiry and told Fay's story. The rider's gray, earnest gaze troubled\n",
       "her. Then he turned to Fay and smiled in a way that made Jane doubt her\n",
       "sense of the true relation of things. How could Lassiter smile so at a\n",
       "child when he had made so many children fatherless? But he did smile,\n",
       "and to the gentleness she had seen a few times he added something that\n",
       "was infinitely sad and sweet. Jane's intuition told her that Lassiter\n",
       "had never been a father, but if life ever so blessed him he would be a\n",
       "good one. Fay, also, must have found that smile singularly winning. For\n",
       "she edged closer and closer, and then, by way of feminine capitulation,\n",
       "went to Jane, from whose side she bent a beautiful glance upon the\n",
       "rider.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter only smiled at her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane watched them, and realized that now was the moment she should\n",
       "seize, if she was ever to win this man from his hatred. But the step was\n",
       "not easy to take. The more she saw of Lassiter the more she respected\n",
       "him, and the greater her respect the harder it became to lend herself to\n",
       "mere coquetry. Yet as she thought of her great motive, of Tull, and\n",
       "of that other whose name she had schooled herself never to think of\n",
       "in connection with Milly Erne's avenger, she suddenly found she had no\n",
       "choice. And her creed gave her boldness far beyond the limit to which\n",
       "vanity would have led her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, I see so little of you now,” she said, and was conscious of\n",
       "heat in her cheeks.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I've been riding hard,” he replied.\n",
       "\n",
       "“But you can't live in the saddle. You come in sometimes. Won't you come\n",
       "here to see me--oftener?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Is that an order?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nonsense! I simply ask you to come to see me when you find time.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The query once heard was not so embarrassing to Jane as she might have\n",
       "imagined. Moreover, it established in her mind a fact that there existed\n",
       "actually other than selfish reasons for her wanting to see him. And as\n",
       "she had been bold, so she determined to be both honest and brave.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I've reasons--only one of which I need mention,” she answered. “If it's\n",
       "possible I want to change you toward my people. And on the moment I can\n",
       "conceive of little I wouldn't do to gain that end.”\n",
       "\n",
       "How much better and freer Jane felt after that confession! She meant to\n",
       "show him that there was one Mormon who could play a game or wage a fight\n",
       "in the open.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon,” said Lassiter, and he laughed.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was the best in her, if the most irritating, that Lassiter always\n",
       "aroused.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Will you come?” She looked into his eyes, and for the life of her could\n",
       "not quite subdue an imperiousness that rose with her spirit. “I never\n",
       "asked so much of any man--except Bern Venters.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“'Pears to me that you'd run no risk, or Venters, either. But mebbe that\n",
       "doesn't hold good for me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“You mean it wouldn't be safe for you to be often here? You look for\n",
       "ambush in the cottonwoods?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Not that so much.”\n",
       "\n",
       "At this juncture little Fay sidled over to Lassiter.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Has oo a little dirl?” she inquired.\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, lassie,” replied the rider.\n",
       "\n",
       "Whatever Fay seemed to be searching for in Lassiter's sun-reddened face\n",
       "and quiet eyes she evidently found. “Oo tan tom to see me,” she added,\n",
       "and with that, shyness gave place to friendly curiosity. First his\n",
       "sombrero with its leather band and silver ornaments commanded her\n",
       "attention; next his quirt, and then the clinking, silver spurs. These\n",
       "held her for some time, but presently, true to childish fickleness, she\n",
       "left off playing with them to look for something else. She laughed in\n",
       "glee as she ran her little hands down the slippery, shiny surface\n",
       "of Lassiter's leather chaps. Soon she discovered one of the hanging\n",
       "gun--sheaths, and she dragged it up and began tugging at the huge black\n",
       "handle of the gun. Jane Withersteen repressed an exclamation. What\n",
       "significance there was to her in the little girl's efforts to dislodge\n",
       "that heavy weapon! Jane Withersteen saw Fay's play and her beauty and\n",
       "her love as most powerful allies to her own woman's part in a game that\n",
       "suddenly had acquired a strange zest and a hint of danger. And as for\n",
       "the rider, he appeared to have forgotten Jane in the wonder of this\n",
       "lovely child playing about him. At first he was much the shyer of the\n",
       "two. Gradually her confidence overcame his backwardness, and he had the\n",
       "temerity to stroke her golden curls with a great hand. Fay rewarded his\n",
       "boldness with a smile, and when he had gone to the extreme of closing\n",
       "that great hand over her little brown one, she said, simply, “I like\n",
       "oo!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Sight of his face then made Jane oblivious for the time to his character\n",
       "as a hater of Mormons. Out of the mother longing that swelled her breast\n",
       "she divined the child hunger in Lassiter.\n",
       "\n",
       "He returned the next day, and the next; and upon the following he came\n",
       "both at morning and at night. Upon the evening of this fourth day Jane\n",
       "seemed to feel the breaking of a brooding struggle in Lassiter. During\n",
       "all these visits he had scarcely a word to say, though he watched her\n",
       "and played absent-mindedly with Fay. Jane had contented herself with\n",
       "silence. Soon little Fay substituted for the expression of regard, “I\n",
       "like oo,” a warmer and more generous one, “I love oo.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Thereafter Lassiter came oftener to see Jane and her little protegee.\n",
       "Daily he grew more gentle and kind, and gradually developed a quaintly\n",
       "merry mood. In the morning he lifted Fay upon his horse and let her\n",
       "ride as he walked beside her to the edge of the sage. In the evening he\n",
       "played with the child at an infinite variety of games she invented,\n",
       "and then, oftener than not, he accepted Jane's invitation to supper. No\n",
       "other visitor came to Withersteen House during those days. So that in\n",
       "spite of watchfulness he never forgot, Lassiter began to show he felt at\n",
       "home there. After the meal they walked into the grove of cottonwoods or\n",
       "up by the lakes, and little Fay held Lassiter's hand as much as she held\n",
       "Jane's. Thus a strange relationship was established, and Jane liked it.\n",
       "At twilight they always returned to the house, where Fay kissed them and\n",
       "went in to her mother. Lassiter and Jane were left alone.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, if there were anything that a good woman could do to win a man\n",
       "and still preserve her self-respect, it was something which escaped the\n",
       "natural subtlety of a woman determined to allure. Jane's vanity, that\n",
       "after all was not great, was soon satisfied with Lassiter's silent\n",
       "admiration. And her honest desire to lead him from his dark,\n",
       "blood-stained path would never have blinded her to what she owed\n",
       "herself. But the driving passion of her religion, and its call to save\n",
       "Mormons' lives, one life in particular, bore Jane Withersteen close to\n",
       "an infringement of her womanhood. In the beginning she had reasoned that\n",
       "her appeal to Lassiter must be through the senses. With whatever means\n",
       "she possessed in the way of adornment she enhanced her beauty. And she\n",
       "stooped to artifices that she knew were unworthy of her, but which\n",
       "she deliberately chose to employ. She made of herself a girl in every\n",
       "variable mood wherein a girl might be desirable. In those moods she was\n",
       "not above the methods of an inexperienced though natural flirt. She\n",
       "kept close to him whenever opportunity afforded; and she was forever\n",
       "playfully, yet passionately underneath the surface, fighting him for\n",
       "possession of the great black guns. These he would never yield to her.\n",
       "And so in that manner their hands were often and long in contact. The\n",
       "more of simplicity that she sensed in him the greater the advantage she\n",
       "took.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had a trick of changing--and it was not altogether voluntary--from\n",
       "this gay, thoughtless, girlish coquettishness to the silence and the\n",
       "brooding, burning mystery of a woman's mood. The strength and passion\n",
       "and fire of her were in her eyes, and she so used them that Lassiter had\n",
       "to see this depth in her, this haunting promise more fitted to her years\n",
       "than to the flaunting guise of a wilful girl.\n",
       "\n",
       "The July days flew by. Jane reasoned that if it were possible for her to\n",
       "be happy during such a time, then she was happy. Little Fay completely\n",
       "filled a long aching void in her heart. In fettering the hands of this\n",
       "Lassiter she was accomplishing the greatest good of her life, and to do\n",
       "good even in a small way rendered happiness to Jane Withersteen. She had\n",
       "attended the regular Sunday services of her church; otherwise she had\n",
       "not gone to the village for weeks. It was unusual that none of her\n",
       "churchmen or friends had called upon her of late; but it was neglect\n",
       "for which she was glad. Judkins and his boy riders had experienced no\n",
       "difficulty in driving the white herd. So these warm July days were free\n",
       "of worry, and soon Jane hoped she had passed the crisis; and for her to\n",
       "hope was presently to trust, and then to believe. She thought often of\n",
       "Venters, but in a dreamy, abstract way. She spent hours teaching and\n",
       "playing with little Fay. And the activity of her mind centered around\n",
       "Lassiter. The direction she had given her will seemed to blunt any\n",
       "branching off of thought from that straight line. The mood came to\n",
       "obsess her.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the end, when her awakening came, she learned that she had builded\n",
       "better than she knew. Lassiter, though kinder and gentler than ever, had\n",
       "parted with his quaint humor and his coldness and his tranquillity to\n",
       "become a restless and unhappy man. Whatever the power of his deadly\n",
       "intent toward Mormons, that passion now had a rival, the one equally\n",
       "burning and consuming. Jane Withersteen had one moment of exultation\n",
       "before the dawn of a strange uneasiness. What if she had made of herself\n",
       "a lure, at tremendous cost to him and to her, and all in vain!\n",
       "\n",
       "That night in the moonlit grove she summoned all her courage and,\n",
       "turning suddenly in the path, she faced Lassiter and leaned close to\n",
       "him, so that she touched him and her eyes looked up to his.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter!... Will you do anything for me?”\n",
       "\n",
       "In the moonlight she saw his dark, worn face change, and by that change\n",
       "she seemed to feel him immovable as a wall of stone.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane slipped her hands down to the swinging gun-sheaths, and when she\n",
       "had locked her fingers around the huge, cold handles of the guns, she\n",
       "trembled as with a chilling ripple over all her body.\n",
       "\n",
       "“May I take your guns?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why?” he asked, and for the first time to her his voice carried a harsh\n",
       "note. Jane felt his hard, strong hands close round her wrists. It was\n",
       "not wholly with intent that she leaned toward him, for the look of his\n",
       "eyes and the feel of his hands made her weak.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's no trifle--no woman's whim--it's deep--as my heart. Let me take\n",
       "them?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I want to keep you from killing more men--Mormons. You must let me save\n",
       "you from more wickedness--more wanton bloodshed--” Then the truth forced\n",
       "itself falteringly from her lips. “You must--let--help me to keep my vow\n",
       "to Milly Erne. I swore to her--as she lay dying--that if ever any one\n",
       "came here to avenge her--I swore I would stay his hand. Perhaps I--I\n",
       "alone can save the--the man who--who--Oh, Lassiter!... I feel that I\n",
       "can't change you--then soon you'll be out to kill--and you'll kill\n",
       "by instinct--and among the Mormons you kill will be the\n",
       "one--who... Lassiter, if you care a little for me--let me--for my\n",
       "sake--let me take your guns!”\n",
       "\n",
       "As if her hands had been those of a child, he unclasped their clinging\n",
       "grip from the handles of his guns, and, pushing her away, he turned his\n",
       "gray face to her in one look of terrible realization and then strode off\n",
       "into the shadows of the cottonwoods.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the first shock of her futile appeal to Lassiter had passed, Jane\n",
       "took his cold, silent condemnation and abrupt departure not so much as a\n",
       "refusal to her entreaty as a hurt and stunned bitterness for her\n",
       "attempt at his betrayal. Upon further thought and slow consideration of\n",
       "Lassiter's past actions, she believed he would return and forgive her.\n",
       "The man could not be hard to a woman, and she doubted that he could\n",
       "stay away from her. But at the point where she had hoped to find him\n",
       "vulnerable she now began to fear he was proof against all persuasion.\n",
       "The iron and stone quality that she had early suspected in him had\n",
       "actually cropped out as an impregnable barrier. Nevertheless, if\n",
       "Lassiter remained in Cottonwoods she would never give up her hope and\n",
       "desire to change him. She would change him if she had to sacrifice\n",
       "everything dear to her except hope of heaven. Passionately devoted as\n",
       "she was to her religion, she had yet refused to marry a Mormon. But a\n",
       "situation had developed wherein self paled in the great white light of\n",
       "religious duty of the highest order. That was the leading motive,\n",
       "the divinely spiritual one; but there were other motives, which, like\n",
       "tentacles, aided in drawing her will to the acceptance of a possible\n",
       "abnegation. And through the watches of that sleepless night Jane\n",
       "Withersteen, in fear and sorrow and doubt, came finally to believe that\n",
       "if she must throw herself into Lassiter's arms to make him abide by\n",
       "“Thou shalt not kill!” she would yet do well.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the morning she expected Lassiter at the usual hour, but she was not\n",
       "able to go at once to the court, so she sent little Fay. Mrs. Larkin was\n",
       "ill and required attention. It appeared that the mother, from the time\n",
       "of her arrival at Withersteen House, had relaxed and was slowly\n",
       "losing her hold on life. Jane had believed that absence of worry and\n",
       "responsibility coupled with good nursing and comfort would mend Mrs.\n",
       "Larkin's broken health. Such, however, was not the case.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Jane did get out to the court, Fay was there alone, and at the\n",
       "moment embarking on a dubious voyage down the stone-lined amber stream\n",
       "upon a craft of two brooms and a pillow. Fay was as delightfully wet as\n",
       "she could possibly wish to get.\n",
       "\n",
       "Clatter of hoofs distracted Fay and interrupted the scolding she was\n",
       "gleefully receiving from Jane. The sound was not the light-spirited trot\n",
       "that Bells made when Lassiter rode him into the outer court. This was\n",
       "slower and heavier, and Jane did not recognize in it any of her other\n",
       "horses. The appearance of Bishop Dyer startled Jane. He dismounted with\n",
       "his rapid, jerky motion flung the bridle, and, as he turned toward the\n",
       "inner court and stalked up on the stone flags, his boots rang. In his\n",
       "authoritative front, and in the red anger unmistakably flaming in his\n",
       "face, he reminded Jane of her father.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Is that the Larkin pauper?” he asked, bruskly, without any greeting to\n",
       "Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's Mrs. Larkin's little girl,” replied Jane, slowly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I hear you intend to raise the child?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Of course you mean to give her Mormon bringing-up?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No.”\n",
       "\n",
       "His questions had been swift. She was amazed at a feeling that some one\n",
       "else was replying for her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I've come to say a few things to you.” He stopped to measure her with\n",
       "stern, speculative eye.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane Withersteen loved this man. From earliest childhood she had been\n",
       "taught to revere and love bishops of her church. And for ten years\n",
       "Bishop Dyer had been the closest friend and counselor of her father,\n",
       "and for the greater part of that period her own friend and Scriptural\n",
       "teacher. Her interpretation of her creed and her religious activity in\n",
       "fidelity to it, her acceptance of mysterious and holy Mormon truths,\n",
       "were all invested in this Bishop. Bishop Dyer as an entity was next\n",
       "to God. He was God's mouthpiece to the little Mormon community at\n",
       "Cottonwoods. God revealed himself in secret to this mortal.\n",
       "\n",
       "And Jane Withersteen suddenly suffered a paralyzing affront to her\n",
       "consciousness of reverence by some strange, irresistible twist of\n",
       "thought wherein she saw this Bishop as a man. And the train of thought\n",
       "hurdled the rising, crying protests of that other self whose poise she\n",
       "had lost. It was not her Bishop who eyed her in curious measurement. It\n",
       "was a man who tramped into her presence without removing his hat, who\n",
       "had no greeting for her, who had no semblance of courtesy. In looks,\n",
       "as in action, he made her think of a bull stamping cross-grained into a\n",
       "corral. She had heard of Bishop Dyer forgetting the minister in the fury\n",
       "of a common man, and now she was to feel it. The glance by which she\n",
       "measured him in turn momentarily veiled the divine in the ordinary.\n",
       "He looked a rancher; he was booted, spurred, and covered with dust; he\n",
       "carried a gun at his hip, and she remembered that he had been known\n",
       "to use it. But during the long moment while he watched her there was\n",
       "nothing commonplace in the slow-gathering might of his wrath.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Brother Tull has talked to me,” he began. “It was your father's wish\n",
       "that you marry Tull, and my order. You refused him?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“You would not give up your friendship with that tramp Venters?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“But you'll do as _I_ order!” he thundered. “Why, Jane Withersteen, you\n",
       "are in danger of becoming a heretic! You can thank your Gentile friends\n",
       "for that. You face the damning of your soul to perdition.”\n",
       "\n",
       "In the flux and reflux of the whirling torture of Jane's mind, that new,\n",
       "daring spirit of hers vanished in the old habitual order of her life.\n",
       "She was a Mormon, and the Bishop regained ascendance.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's well I got you in time, Jane Withersteen. What would your father\n",
       "have said to these goings-on of yours? He would have put you in a\n",
       "stone cage on bread and water. He would have taught you something about\n",
       "Mormonism. Remember, you're a born Mormon. There have been Mormons who\n",
       "turned heretic--damn their souls!--but no born Mormon ever left us yet.\n",
       "Ah, I see your shame. Your faith is not shaken. You are only a wild\n",
       "girl.” The Bishop's tone softened. “Well, it's enough that I got to you\n",
       "in time.... Now tell me about this Lassiter. I hear strange things.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What do you wish to know?” queried Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“About this man. You hired him?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes, he's riding for me. When my riders left me I had to have any one I\n",
       "could get.”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“But what's he doing here in Cottonwoods? This place isn't notorious\n",
       "enough for such a man. Sterling and the villages north, where there's\n",
       "universal gun-packing and fights every day--where there are more men\n",
       "like him, it seems to me they would attract him most. We're only a wild,\n",
       "lonely border settlement. It's only recently that the rustlers have made\n",
       "killings here. Nor have there been saloons till lately, nor the drifting\n",
       "in of outcasts. Has not this gun-man some special mission here?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane maintained silence.\n",
       "\n",

       "curiosity.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That first day,” whispered Jane, “Lassiter said he came here to\n",

       "\n",
       "With downcast eyes Jane watched the swift flow of the amber water. She\n",
       "saw it and tried to think of it, of the stones, of the ferns; but, like\n",
       "her body, her mind was in a leaden vise. Only the Bishop's voice could\n",
       "release her. Seemingly there was silence of longer duration than all her\n",
       "former life.\n",
       "\n",
       "“For what--else?” When Bishop Dyer's voice did cleave the silence it was\n",
       "high, curiously shrill, and on the point of breaking. It released Jane's\n",
       "tongue, but she could not lift her eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“To kill the man who persuaded Milly Erne to abandon her home and her\n",
       "husband--and her God!”\n",
       "\n",
       "With wonderful distinctness Jane Withersteen heard her own clear voice.\n",
       "She heard the water murmur at her feet and flow on to the sea; she heard\n",
       "the rushing of all the waters in the world. They filled her ears with\n",
       "low, unreal murmurings--these sounds that deadened her brain and\n",
       "yet could not break the long and terrible silence. Then, from\n",
       "somewhere--from an immeasurable distance--came a slow, guarded,\n",
       "clinking, clanking step. Into her it shot electrifying life. It released\n",
       "the weight upon her numbed eyelids. Lifting her eyes she saw--ashen,\n",
       "shaken, stricken--not the Bishop but the man! And beyond him, from\n",
       "round the corner came that soft, silvery step. A long black boot with a\n",
       "gleaming spur swept into sight--and then Lassiter! Bishop Dyer did not\n",
       "see, did not hear: he stared at Jane in the throes of sudden revelation.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ah, I understand!” he cried, in hoarse accents. “That's why you made\n",
       "love to this Lassiter--to bind his hands!”\n",
       "\n",
       "It was Jane's gaze riveted upon the rider that made Bishop Dyer turn.\n",
       "Then clear sight failed her. Dizzily, in a blur, she saw the Bishop's\n",
       "hand jerk to his hip. She saw gleam of blue and spout of red. In her\n",
       "ears burst a thundering report. The court floated in darkening circles\n",
       "around her, and she fell into utter blackness.\n",
       "\n",
       "The darkness lightened, turned to slow-drifting haze, and lifted.\n",
       "Through a thin film of blue smoke she saw the rough-hewn timbers of\n",
       "the court roof. A cool, damp touch moved across her brow. She smelled\n",
       "powder, and it was that which galvanized her suspended thought. She\n",
       "moved, to see that she lay prone upon the stone flags with her head on\n",
       "Lassiter's knee, and he was bathing her brow with water from the stream.\n",
       "The same swift glance, shifting low, brought into range of her sight a\n",
       "smoking gun and splashes of blood.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ah-h!” she moaned, and was drifting, sinking again into darkness, when\n",
       "Lassiter's voice arrested her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's all right, Jane. It's all right.”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“Say! It was queer for you to faint. I thought you were such a strong\n",

       "I thought you'd never come to. But I'm awkward round women folks. I\n",

       "\n",
       "“Lassiter!... the gun there!... the blood!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“So that's troublin' you. I reckon it needn't. You see it was this way.\n",
       "I come round the house an' seen that fat party an' heard him talkin'\n",
       "loud. Then he seen me, an' very impolite goes straight for his gun. He\n",
       "oughtn't have tried to throw a gun on me--whatever his reason was. For\n",
       "that's meetin' me on my own grounds. I've seen runnin' molasses that\n",
       "was quicker 'n him. Now I didn't know who he was, visitor or friend\n",
       "or relation of yours, though I seen he was a Mormon all over, an' I\n",
       "couldn't get serious about shootin'. So I winged him--put a bullet\n",
       "through his arm as he was pullin' at his gun. An' he dropped the\n",
       "gun there, an' a little blood. I told him he'd introduced himself\n",
       "sufficient, an' to please move out of my vicinity. An' he went.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter spoke with slow, cool, soothing voice, in which there was a\n",
       "hint of levity, and his touch, as he continued to bathe her brow, was\n",
       "gentle and steady. His impassive face, and the kind gray eyes, further\n",
       "stilled her agitation.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He drew on you first, and you deliberately shot to cripple him--you\n",

       "\n",

       "party was.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He helped Jane to her feet and to a chair. Then with the wet scarf he\n",
       "had used to bathe her face he wiped the blood from the stone flags and,\n",
       "picking up the gun, he threw it upon a couch. With that he began to\n",
       "pace the court, and his silver spurs jangled musically, and the great\n",
       "gun-sheaths softly brushed against his leather chaps.\n",
       "\n",
       "“So--it's true--what I heard him say?” Lassiter asked, presently halting\n",

       "\n",
       "Jane received a letter from Bishop Dyer, not in his own handwriting,\n",
       "which stated that the abrupt termination of their interview had left\n",
       "him in some doubt as to her future conduct. A slight injury had\n",
       "incapacitated him from seeking another meeting at present, the letter\n",
       "went on to say, and ended with a request which was virtually a command,\n",
       "that she call upon him at once.\n",
       "\n",
       "The reading of the letter acquainted Jane Withersteen with the fact that\n",
       "something within her had all but changed. She sent no reply to Bishop\n",
       "Dyer nor did she go to see him. On Sunday she remained absent from the\n",
       "service--for the second time in years--and though she did not actually\n",
       "suffer there was a dead-lock of feelings deep within her, and the\n",
       "waiting for a balance to fall on either side was almost as bad as\n",
       "suffering. She had a gloomy expectancy of untoward circumstances,\n",
       "and with it a keen-edged curiosity to watch developments. She had\n",
       "a half-formed conviction that her future conduct--as related to her\n",
       "churchmen--was beyond her control and would be governed by their\n",
       "attitude toward her. Something was changing in her, forming, waiting for\n",
       "decision to make it a real and fixed thing. She had told Lassiter that\n",
       "she felt helpless and lost in the fateful tangle of their lives; and now\n",
       "she feared that she was approaching the same chaotic condition of mind\n",
       "in regard to her religion. It appalled her to find that she questioned\n",
       "phases of that religion. Absolute faith had been her serenity. Though\n",
       "leaving her faith unshaken, her serenity had been disturbed, and now\n",
       "it was broken by open war between her and her ministers. That something\n",
       "within her--a whisper--which she had tried in vain to hush had become\n",
       "a ringing voice, and it called to her to wait. She had transgressed\n",
       "no laws of God. Her churchmen, however invested with the power and the\n",
       "glory of a wonderful creed, however they sat in inexorable judgment of\n",
       "her, must now practice toward her the simple, common, Christian virtue\n",
       "they professed to preach, “Do unto others as you would have others do\n",
       "unto you!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane Withersteen, waiting in darkness of mind, remained faithful still.\n",
       "But it was darkness that must soon be pierced by light. If her faith\n",
       "were justified, if her churchmen were trying only to intimidate her, the\n",
       "fact would soon be manifest, as would their failure, and then she would\n",
       "redouble her zeal toward them and toward what had been the best work\n",
       "of her life--work for the welfare and happiness of those among whom she\n",
       "lived, Mormon and Gentile alike. If that secret, intangible power closed\n",
       "its coils round her again, if that great invisible hand moved here and\n",
       "there and everywhere, slowly paralyzing her with its mystery and its\n",
       "inconceivable sway over her affairs, then she would know beyond doubt\n",
       "that it was not chance, nor jealousy, nor intimidation, nor ministerial\n",
       "wrath at her revolt, but a cold and calculating policy thought out long\n",
       "before she was born, a dark, immutable will of whose empire she and all\n",
       "that was hers was but an atom.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then might come her ruin. Then might come her fall into black storm.\n",
       "Yet she would rise again, and to the light. God would be merciful to a\n",

       "\n",
       "A week passed. Little Fay played and prattled and pulled at Lassiter's\n",
       "big black guns. The rider came to Withersteen House oftener than ever.\n",
       "Jane saw a change in him, though it did not relate to his kindness and\n",
       "gentleness. He was quieter and more thoughtful. While playing with Fay\n",
       "or conversing with Jane he seemed to be possessed of another self that\n",
       "watched with cool, roving eyes, that listened, listened always as if the\n",
       "murmuring amber stream brought messages, and the moving leaves whispered\n",
       "something. Lassiter never rode Bells into the court any more, nor did\n",
       "he come by the lane or the paths. When he appeared it was suddenly and\n",
       "noiselessly out of the dark shadow of the grove.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I left Bells out in the sage,” he said, one day at the end of that\n",
       "week. “I must carry water to him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why not let him drink at the trough or here?” asked Jane, quickly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon it'll be safer for me to slip through the grove. I've been\n",
       "watched when I rode in from the sage.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Watched? By whom?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“By a man who thought he was well hid. But my eyes are pretty sharp.\n",
       "An', Jane,” he went on, almost in a whisper, “I reckon it'd be a good\n",
       "idea for us to talk low. You're spied on here by your women.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter!” she whispered in turn. “That's hard to believe. My women\n",
       "love me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What of that?” he asked. “Of course they love you. But they're Mormon\n",
       "women.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane's old, rebellious loyalty clashed with her doubt.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I won't believe it,” she replied, stubbornly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well then, just act natural an' talk natural, an' pretty soon--give\n",
       "them time to hear us--pretend to go over there to the table, en' then\n",
       "quick-like make a move for the door en' open it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I will,” said Jane, with heightened color. Lassiter was right; he never\n",
       "made mistakes; he would not have told her unless he positively knew. Yet\n",
       "Jane was so tenacious of faith that she had to see with her own eyes,\n",
       "and so constituted that to employ even such small deceit toward her\n",
       "women made her ashamed, and angry for her shame as well as theirs. Then\n",
       "a singular thought confronted her that made her hold up this simple\n",
       "ruse--which hurt her, though it was well justified--against the deceit\n",
       "she had wittingly and eagerly used toward Lassiter. The difference was\n",
       "staggering in its suggestion of that blindness of which he had accused\n",
       "her. Fairness and justice and mercy, that she had imagined were\n",
       "anchor-cables to hold fast her soul to righteousness had not been hers\n",
       "in the strange, biased duty that had so exalted and confounded her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Presently Jane began to act her little part, to laugh and play with\n",
       "Fay, to talk of horses and cattle to Lassiter. Then she made deliberate\n",
       "mention of a book in which she kept records of all pertaining to her\n",
       "stock, and she walked slowly toward the table, and when near the door\n",
       "she suddenly whirled and thrust it open. Her sharp action nearly knocked\n",
       "down a woman who had undoubtedly been listening.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hester,” said Jane, sternly, “you may go home, and you need not come\n",
       "back.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane shut the door and returned to Lassiter. Standing unsteadily, she\n",
       "put her hand on his arm. She let him see that doubt had gone, and how\n",
       "this stab of disloyalty pained her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Spies! My own women!... Oh, miserable!” she cried, with flashing,\n",
       "tearful eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I hate to tell you,” he replied. By that she knew he had long spared\n",
       "her. “It's begun again--that work in the dark.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay, Lassiter--it never stopped!”\n",
       "\n",
       "So bitter certainty claimed her at last, and trust fled Withersteen\n",
       "House and fled forever. The women who owed much to Jane Withersteen\n",
       "changed not in love for her, nor in devotion to their household work,\n",
       "but they poisoned both by a thousand acts of stealth and cunning and\n",
       "duplicity. Jane broke out once and caught them in strange, stone-faced,\n",
       "unhesitating falsehood. Thereafter she broke out no more. She forgave\n",
       "them because they were driven. Poor, fettered, and sealed Hagars, how\n",
       "she pitied them! What terrible thing bound them and locked their\n",
       "lips, when they showed neither consciousness of guilt toward their\n",
       "benefactress nor distress at the slow wearing apart of long-established\n",
       "and dear ties?\n",
       "\n",
       "“The blindness again!” cried Jane Withersteen. “In my sisters as in\n",

       "\n",
       "There came a time when no words passed between Jane and her women.\n",
       "Silently they went about their household duties, and secretly they went\n",
       "about the underhand work to which they had been bidden. The gloom of\n",
       "the house and the gloom of its mistress, which darkened even the bright\n",
       "spirit of little Fay, did not pervade these women. Happiness was not\n",
       "among them, but they were aloof from gloom. They spied and listened;\n",
       "they received and sent secret messengers; and they stole Jane's books\n",
       "and records, and finally the papers that were deeds of her possessions.\n",
       "Through it all they were silent, rapt in a kind of trance. Then one by\n",
       "one, without leave or explanation or farewell, they left Withersteen\n",
       "House, and never returned.\n",
       "\n",
       "Coincident with this disappearance Jane's gardeners and workers in the\n",
       "alfalfa fields and stable men quit her, not even asking for their wages.\n",
       "Of all her Mormon employees about the great ranch only Jerd remained. He\n",
       "went on with his duty, but talked no more of the change than if it had\n",
       "never occurred.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jerd,” said Jane, “what stock you can't take care of turn out in the\n",
       "sage. Let your first thought be for Black Star and Night. Keep them in\n",
       "perfect condition. Run them every day and watch them always.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Though Jane Withersteen gave them such liberality, she loved her\n",
       "possessions. She loved the rich, green stretches of alfalfa, and the\n",
       "farms, and the grove, and the old stone house, and the beautiful,\n",
       "ever-faithful amber spring, and every one of a myriad of horses and\n",
       "colts and burros and fowls down to the smallest rabbit that nipped her\n",
       "vegetables; but she loved best her noble Arabian steeds. In common with\n",
       "all riders of the upland sage Jane cherished two material things--the\n",
       "cold, sweet, brown water that made life possible in the wilderness and\n",
       "the horses which were a part of that life. When Lassiter asked her what\n",
       "Lassiter would be without his guns he was assuming that his horse was\n",
       "part of himself. So Jane loved Black Star and Night because it was her\n",
       "nature to love all beautiful creatures--perhaps all living things; and\n",
       "then she loved them because she herself was of the sage and in her\n",
       "had been born and bred the rider's instinct to rely on his four-footed\n",
       "brother. And when Jane gave Jerd the order to keep her favorites trained\n",
       "down to the day it was a half-conscious admission that presaged a time\n",
       "when she would need her fleet horses.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane had now, however, no leisure to brood over the coils that were\n",
       "closing round her. Mrs. Larkin grew weaker as the August days began;\n",
       "she required constant care; there was little Fay to look after; and such\n",
       "household work as was imperative. Lassiter put Bells in the stable with\n",
       "the other racers, and directed his efforts to a closer attendance upon\n",
       "Jane. She welcomed the change. He was always at hand to help, and it was\n",
       "her fortune to learn that his boast of being awkward around women had\n",
       "its root in humility and was not true.\n",
       "\n",
       "His great, brown hands were skilled in a multiplicity of ways which a\n",
       "woman might have envied. He shared Jane's work, and was of especial help\n",
       "to her in nursing Mrs. Larkin. The woman suffered most at night, and\n",
       "this often broke Jane's rest. So it came about that Lassiter would stay\n",
       "by Mrs. Larkin during the day, when she needed care, and Jane would make\n",
       "up the sleep she lost in night-watches. Mrs. Larkin at once took kindly\n",
       "to the gentle Lassiter, and, without ever asking who or what he was,\n",
       "praised him to Jane. “He's a good man and loves children,” she said. How\n",
       "sad to hear this truth spoken of a man whom Jane thought lost beyond all\n",
       "redemption! Yet ever and ever Lassiter towered above her, and behind\n",
       "or through his black, sinister figure shone something luminous that\n",
       "strangely affected Jane. Good and evil began to seem incomprehensibly\n",
       "blended in her judgment. It was her belief that evil could not come\n",
       "forth from good; yet here was a murderer who dwarfed in gentleness,\n",
       "patience, and love any man she had ever known.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had almost lost track of her more outside concerns when early one\n",
       "morning Judkins presented himself before her in the courtyard.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thin, hard, burnt, bearded, with the dust and sage thick on him, with\n",
       "his leather wrist-bands shining from use, and his boots worn through on\n",
       "the stirrup side, he looked the rider of riders. He wore two guns and\n",
       "carried a Winchester.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane greeted him with surprise and warmth, set meat and bread and\n",
       "drink before him; and called Lassiter out to see him. The men exchanged\n",
       "glances, and the meaning of Lassiter's keen inquiry and Judkins's bold\n",
       "reply, both unspoken, was not lost upon Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Where's your hoss?” asked Lassiter, aloud.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Left him down the slope,” answered Judkins. “I footed it in a ways, an'\n",
       "slept last night in the sage. I went to the place you told me you 'moss\n",

       "I--I must--Something makes me tell you the worst is yet to come. That's\n",

       "not one was true. You've made it easy to forgive. Perhaps many of\n",

       "hoped it'd not be necessary to tell you that my mother on her deathbed\n",

       "months--weeks--days till the storm breaks. Then you'd have nothing, and\n",
       "be in disgrace with your people. We'll forearm you against poverty, and\n",

       "\n",
       "“Lassiter is with Mrs. Larkin. She is ill. I'll call him,” answered\n",
       "Jane, and going to the door she softly called for the rider. A faint,\n",

       "threshold.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, here's Blake, an old rider of mine. He has come back to me\n",

       "\n",
       "Blake's brown face turned exceedingly pale.\n",
       "\n",

       "Mormon and a rider. Lately I quit Miss Withersteen. I've come to beg her\n",
       "to take me back. Now I don't know you; but I know--what you are. So\n",
       "I've this to say to your face. It would never occur to this woman to\n",
       "imagine--let alone suspect me to be a spy. She couldn't think it\n",
       "might just be a low plot to come here and shoot you in the back. Jane\n",
       "Withersteen hasn't that kind of a mind.... Well, I've not come for that.\n",

       "The thing is--do you believe me?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon I do,” replied Lassiter. How this slow, cool speech contrasted\n",
       "with Blake's hot, impulsive words! “You might have saved some of your\n",
       "breath. See here, Blake, cinch this in your mind. Lassiter has met some\n",
       "square Mormons! An' mebbe--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Blake,” interrupted Jane, nervously anxious to terminate a colloquy\n",
       "that she perceived was an ordeal for him. “Go at once and fetch me a\n",
       "report of my horses.”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“Lassiter--did you know?” asked Jane, whirling to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon so.... But what was the use to tell you?”\n",
       "\n",
       "It was Lassiter turning away his face and Blake studying the stone flags\n",
       "at his feet that brought Jane to the understanding of what she betrayed.\n",
       "She strove desperately, but she could not rise immediately from such a\n",
       "blow.\n",
       "\n",
       "“My horses! My horses! What's become of them?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Dorn said the riders report another drive by Oldring.... And I trailed\n",
       "the horses miles down the slope toward Deception Pass.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“My red herd's gone! My horses gone! The white herd will go next. I can\n",
       "stand that. But if I lost Black Star and Night, it would be like parting\n",
       "with my own flesh and blood. Lassiter--Blake--am I in danger of losing\n",
       "my racers?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“A rustler--or--or anybody stealin' hosses of yours would most of all\n",

       "\n",
       "“Oh! Oh!” Jane Withersteen choked, with violent utterance.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Let me take charge of the blacks?” asked Blake. “One more rider won't\n",

       "you put such store on their value.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Value! Blake, I love my racers. Besides, there's another reason why I\n",
       "mustn't lose them. You go to the stables. Go with Jerd every day when\n",
       "he runs the horses, and don't let them out of your sight. If you would\n",
       "please me--win my gratitude, guard my black racers.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When Blake had mounted and ridden out of the court Lassiter regarded\n",

       "\n",
       "“'Pears to me, as Blake says, you do put some store on them hosses. Now\n",
       "I ain't gainsayin' that the Arabians are the handsomest hosses I ever\n",

       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, don't tease me now. I'm miserable--sick. Bells is fast, but\n",

       "could kill your favorites.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, no,” replied Jane, impatiently. “Lassiter, why do you say that\n",
       "so often? I know you've teased me at times, and I believe it's only\n",
       "kindness. You're always trying to keep my mind off worry. But you mean\n",
       "more by this repeated mention of my racers?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon so.” Lassiter paused, and for the thousandth time in her\n",
       "presence moved his black sombrero round and round, as if counting the\n",
       "silver pieces on the band. “Well, Jane, I've sort of read a little\n",

       "know Venters had him. But you can never tell. Mebbe he hasn't got him\n",

       "\n",
       "“God knows you're right!... Poor Bern, how long he's gone! In my trouble\n",
       "I've been forgetting him. But, Lassiter, I've little fear for him. I've\n",
       "heard my riders say he's as keen as a wolf.... As to your reading my\n",
       "thoughts--well, your suggestion makes an actual thought of what was\n",
       "only one of my dreams. I believe I dreamed of flying from this wild\n",
       "borderland, Lassiter. I've strange dreams. I'm not always practical\n",
       "and thinking of my many duties, as you said once. For instance--if I\n",

       "learned how and why he had come to love both child and mistress, when he\n",
       "had stood beside Milly Erne's grave. But one and all they could not be\n",
       "considered in the light of his present agitation. Not only did Lassiter\n",
       "turn white--not only did he grow tense, not only did he lose his\n",
       "coolness, but also he suddenly, violently, hungrily took her into his\n",
       "arms and crushed her to his breast.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter!” cried Jane, trembling. It was an action for which she took\n",
       "sole blame. Instantly, as if dazed, weakened, he released her. “Forgive\n",

       "of you as my faithful friend. I'm always making you out more than\n",
       "human... only, let me say--I meant that--about riding away. I'm wretched,\n",

       "“Jane, the hell--of it,” he replied, with deep intake of breath, “is you\n",

       "way, as much as the crazy boy's rapture your words gave me. I don't\n",

       "\n",
       "In his hidden valley Venters awakened from sleep, and his ears rang\n",
       "with innumerable melodies from full-throated mockingbirds, and his eyes\n",
       "opened wide upon the glorious golden shaft of sunlight shining through\n",
       "the great stone bridge. The circle of cliffs surrounding Surprise Valley\n",
       "lay shrouded in morning mist, a dim blue low down along the terraces,\n",
       "a creamy, moving cloud along the ramparts. The oak forest in the center\n",
       "was a plumed and tufted oval of gold.\n",
       "\n",
       "He saw Bess under the spruces. Upon her complete recovery of strength\n",
       "she always rose with the dawn. At the moment she was feeding the\n",
       "quail she had tamed. And she had begun to tame the mocking-birds. They\n",
       "fluttered among the branches overhead and some left off their songs to\n",
       "flit down and shyly hop near the twittering quail. Little gray and white\n",
       "rabbits crouched in the grass, now nibbling, now laying long ears flat\n",
       "and watching the dogs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters's swift glance took in the brightening valley, and Bess and her\n",
       "pets, and Ring and Whitie. It swept over all to return again and rest\n",
       "upon the girl. She had changed. To the dark trousers and blouse she had\n",
       "added moccasins of her own make, but she no longer resembled a boy.\n",
       "No eye could have failed to mark the rounded contours of a woman. The\n",
       "change had been to grace and beauty. A glint of warm gold gleamed from\n",
       "her hair, and a tint of red shone in the clear dark brown of cheeks. The\n",
       "haunting sweetness of her lips and eyes, that earlier had been illusive,\n",
       "a promise, had become a living fact. She fitted harmoniously into that\n",
       "wonderful setting; she was like Surprise Valley--wild and beautiful.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters leaped out of his cave to begin the day.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had postponed his journey to Cottonwoods until after the passing of\n",
       "the summer rains. The rains were due soon. But until their arrival and\n",
       "the necessity for his trip to the village he sequestered in a far corner\n",
       "of mind all thought of peril, of his past life, and almost that of the\n",
       "present. It was enough to live. He did not want to know what lay hidden\n",
       "in the dim and distant future. Surprise Valley had enchanted him. In\n",
       "this home of the cliff-dwellers there were peace and quiet and solitude,\n",
       "and another thing, wondrous as the golden morning shaft of sunlight,\n",
       "that he dared not ponder over long enough to understand.\n",
       "\n",
       "The solitude he had hated when alone he had now come to love. He was\n",
       "assimilating something from this valley of gleams and shadows. From this\n",
       "strange girl he was assimilating more.\n",
       "\n",
       "The day at hand resembled many days gone before. As Venters had no tools\n",
       "with which to build, or to till the terraces, he remained idle. Beyond\n",
       "the cooking of the simple fare there were no tasks. And as there were no\n",
       "tasks, there was no system. He and Bess began one thing, to leave it;\n",
       "to begin another, to leave that; and then do nothing but lie under the\n",
       "spruces and watch the great cloud-sails majestically move along the\n",
       "ramparts, and dream and dream. The valley was a golden, sunlit world.\n",
       "It was silent. The sighing wind and the twittering quail and the singing\n",
       "birds, even the rare and seldom-occurring hollow crack of a sliding\n",
       "weathered stone, only thickened and deepened that insulated silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters and Bess had vagrant minds.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess, did I tell you about my horse Wrangle?” inquired Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“A hundred times,” she replied.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, have I? I'd forgotten. I want you to see him. He'll carry us both.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'd like to ride him. Can he run?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Run? He's a demon. Swiftest horse on the sage! I hope he'll stay in\n",
       "that canyon.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He'll stay.”\n",
       "\n",
       "They left camp to wander along the terraces, into the aspen ravines,\n",
       "under the gleaming walls. Ring and Whitie wandered in the fore, often\n",
       "turning, often trotting back, open-mouthed and solemn-eyed and happy.\n",
       "Venters lifted his gaze to the grand archway over the entrance to\n",
       "the valley, and Bess lifted hers to follow his, and both were silent.\n",
       "Sometimes the bridge held their attention for a long time. To-day a\n",
       "soaring eagle attracted them.\n",
       "\n",
       "“How he sails!” exclaimed Bess. “I wonder where his mate is?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“She's at the nest. It's on the bridge in a crack near the top. I see\n",
       "her often. She's almost white.”\n",
       "\n",
       "They wandered on down the terrace, into the shady, sun-flecked forest.\n",
       "A brown bird fluttered crying from a bush. Bess peeped into the leaves.\n",
       "“Look! A nest and four little birds. They're not afraid of us. See how\n",
       "they open their mouths. They're hungry.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Rabbits rustled the dead brush and pattered away. The forest was full\n",
       "of a drowsy hum of insects. Little darts of purple, that were running\n",
       "quail, crossed the glades. And a plaintive, sweet peeping came from the\n",
       "coverts. Bess's soft step disturbed a sleeping lizard that scampered\n",
       "away over the leaves. She gave chase and caught it, a slim creature of\n",
       "nameless color but of exquisite beauty.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jewel eyes,” she said. “It's like a rabbit--afraid. We won't eat you.\n",
       "There--go.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Murmuring water drew their steps down into a shallow shaded ravine where\n",
       "a brown brook brawled softly over mossy stones. Multitudes of strange,\n",
       "gray frogs with white spots and black eyes lined the rocky bank and\n",
       "leaped only at close approach. Then Venters's eye descried a very thin,\n",
       "very long green snake coiled round a sapling. They drew closer and\n",
       "closer till they could have touched it. The snake had no fear and\n",
       "watched them with scintillating eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's pretty,” said Bess. “How tame! I thought snakes always ran.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No. Even the rabbits didn't run here till the dogs chased them.”\n",
       "\n",
       "On and on they wandered to the wild jumble of massed and broken\n",
       "fragments of cliff at the west end of the valley. The roar of the\n",
       "disappearing stream dinned in their ears. Into this maze of rocks they\n",
       "threaded a tortuous way, climbing, descending, halting to gather wild\n",
       "plums and great lavender lilies, and going on at the will of fancy. Idle\n",
       "and keen perceptions guided them equally.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, let us climb there!” cried Bess, pointing upward to a small space\n",
       "of terrace left green and shady between huge abutments of broken cliff.\n",
       "And they climbed to the nook and rested and looked out across the valley\n",
       "to the curling column of blue smoke from their campfire. But the cool\n",
       "shade and the rich grass and the fine view were not what they had\n",
       "climbed for. They could not have told, although whatever had drawn\n",
       "them was well-satisfying. Light, sure-footed as a mountain goat, Bess\n",
       "pattered down at Venters's heels; and they went on, calling the dogs,\n",
       "eyes dreamy and wide, listening to the wind and the bees and the\n",
       "crickets and the birds.\n",
       "\n",
       "Part of the time Ring and Whitie led the way, then Venters, then Bess;\n",
       "and the direction was not an object. They left the sun-streaked shade of\n",
       "the oaks, brushed the long grass of the meadows, entered the green\n",
       "and fragrant swaying willows, to stop, at length, under the huge old\n",
       "cottonwoods where the beavers were busy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here they rested and watched. A dam of brush and logs and mud and stones\n",
       "backed the stream into a little lake. The round, rough beaver houses\n",
       "projected from the water. Like the rabbits, the beavers had become shy.\n",
       "Gradually, however, as Venters and Bess knelt low, holding the dogs, the\n",
       "beavers emerged to swim with logs and gnaw at cottonwoods and pat mud\n",
       "walls with their paddle-like tails, and, glossy and shiny in the sun, to\n",
       "go on with their strange, persistent industry. They were the builders.\n",
       "The lake was a mud-hole, and the immediate environment a scarred and\n",
       "dead region, but it was a wonderful home of wonderful animals.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Look at that one--he puddles in the mud,” said Bess. “And there! See\n",
       "him dive! Hear them gnawing! I'd think they'd break their teeth. How's\n",
       "it they can stay out of the water and under the water?”\n",
       "\n",
       "And she laughed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Venters and Bess wandered farther, and, perhaps not all\n",
       "unconsciously this time, wended their slow steps to the cave of the\n",
       "cliff-dwellers, where she liked best to go.\n",
       "\n",
       "The tangled thicket and the long slant of dust and little chips of\n",
       "weathered rock and the steep bench of stone and the worn steps all\n",
       "were arduous work for Bess in the climbing. But she gained the shelf,\n",
       "gasping, hot of cheek, glad of eye, with her hand in Venters's. Here\n",
       "they rested. The beautiful valley glittered below with its millions\n",
       "of wind-turned leaves bright-faced in the sun, and the mighty bridge\n",
       "towered heavenward, crowned with blue sky. Bess, however, never rested\n",
       "for long. Soon she was exploring, and Venters followed; she dragged\n",
       "forth from corners and shelves a multitude of crudely fashioned and\n",
       "painted pieces of pottery, and he carried them. They peeped down into\n",
       "the dark holes of the kivas, and Bess gleefully dropped a stone and\n",
       "waited for the long-coming hollow sound to rise. They peeped into the\n",
       "little globular houses, like mud-wasp nests, and wondered if these had\n",
       "been store-places for grain, or baby cribs, or what; and they crawled\n",
       "into the larger houses and laughed when they bumped their heads on the\n",
       "low roofs, and they dug in the dust of the floors. And they brought from\n",
       "dust and darkness armloads of treasure which they carried to the light.\n",
       "Flints and stones and strange curved sticks and pottery they found; and\n",
       "twisted grass rope that crumbled in their hands, and bits of whitish\n",
       "stone which crushed to powder at a touch and seemed to vanish in the\n",
       "air.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That white stuff was bone,” said Venters, slowly. “Bones of a\n",
       "cliff-dweller.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No!” exclaimed Bess.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Here's another piece. Look!... Whew! dry, powdery smoke! That's bone.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then it was that Venters's primitive, childlike mood, like a savage's,\n",
       "seeing, yet unthinking, gave way to the encroachment of civilized\n",
       "thought. The world had not been made for a single day's play or fancy or\n",
       "idle watching. The world was old. Nowhere could be gotten a better\n",
       "idea of its age than in this gigantic silent tomb. The gray ashes in\n",
       "Venters's hand had once been bone of a human being like himself. The\n",
       "pale gloom of the cave had shadowed people long ago. He saw that Bess\n",
       "had received the same shock--could not in moments such as this escape\n",
       "her feeling living, thinking destiny.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern, people have lived here,” she said, with wide, thoughtful eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes,” he replied.\n",
       "\n",
       "“How long ago?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“A thousand years and more.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What were they?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Cliff-dwellers. Men who had enemies and made their homes high out of\n",
       "reach.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“They had to fight?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“They fought for--what?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“For life. For their homes, food, children, parents--for their women!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Has the world changed any in a thousand years?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I don't know--perhaps a little.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Have men?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I hope so--I think so.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Things crowd into my mind,” she went on, and the wistful light in her\n",
       "eyes told Venters the truth of her thoughts. “I've ridden the border of\n",
       "Utah. I've seen people--know how they live--but they must be few of all\n",
       "who are living. I had my books and I studied them. But all that doesn't\n",
       "help me any more. I want to go out into the big world and see it. Yet I\n",
       "want to stay here more. What's to become of us? Are we cliff-dwellers?\n",
       "We're alone here. I'm happy when I don't think. These--these bones that\n",
       "fly into dust--they make me sick and a little afraid. Did the people who\n",
       "lived here once have the same feelings as we have? What was the good of\n",
       "their living at all? They're gone! What's the meaning of it all--of us?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess, you ask more than I can tell. It's beyond me. Only there was\n",
       "laughter here once--and now there's silence. There was life--and now\n",
       "there's death. Men cut these little steps, made these arrow-heads and\n",
       "mealing-stones, plaited the ropes we found, and left their bones to\n",
       "crumble in our fingers. As far as time is concerned it might all have\n",
       "been yesterday. We're here to-day. Maybe we're higher in the scale of\n",
       "human beings--in intelligence. But who knows? We can't be any higher in\n",
       "the things for which life is lived at all.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What are they?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why--I suppose relationship, friendship--love.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Love!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes. Love of man for woman--love of woman for man. That's the nature,\n",
       "the meaning, the best of life itself.”\n",
       "\n",
       "She said no more. Wistfulness of glance deepened into sadness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Come, let us go,” said Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "Action brightened her. Beside him, holding his hand she slipped down\n",
       "the shelf, ran down the long, steep slant of sliding stones, out of the\n",
       "cloud of dust, and likewise out of the pale gloom.\n",
       "\n",
       "“We beat the slide,” she cried.\n",
       "\n",
       "The miniature avalanche cracked and roared, and rattled itself into an\n",
       "inert mass at the base of the incline. Yellow dust like the gloom of the\n",
       "cave, but not so changeless, drifted away on the wind; the roar clapped\n",
       "in echo from the cliff, returned, went back, and came again to die\n",
       "in the hollowness. Down on the sunny terrace there was a different\n",
       "atmosphere. Ring and Whitie leaped around Bess. Once more she was\n",
       "smiling, gay, and thoughtless, with the dream-mood in the shadow of her\n",
       "eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess, I haven't seen that since last summer. Look!” said Venters,\n",
       "pointing to the scalloped edge of rolling purple clouds that peeped over\n",
       "the western wall. “We're in for a storm.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, I hope not. I'm afraid of storms.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Are you? Why?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Have you ever been down in one of these walled-up pockets in a bad\n",
       "storm?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, now I think of it, I haven't.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, it's terrible. Every summer I get scared to death and hide\n",
       "somewhere in the dark. Storms up on the sage are bad, but nothing to\n",
       "what they are down here in the canyons. And in this little valley--why,\n",
       "echoes can rap back and forth so quick they'll split our ears.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“We're perfectly safe here, Bess.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I know. But that hasn't anything to do with it. The truth is I'm afraid\n",
       "of lightning and thunder, and thunder-claps hurt my head. If we have a\n",
       "bad storm, will you stay close to me?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When they got back to camp the afternoon was closing, and it was\n",
       "exceedingly sultry. Not a breath of air stirred the aspen leaves, and\n",
       "when these did not quiver the air was indeed still. The dark-purple\n",
       "clouds moved almost imperceptibly out of the west.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What have we for supper?” asked Bess.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Rabbit.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern, can't you think of another new way to cook rabbit?” went on Bess,\n",
       "with earnestness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What do you think I am--a magician?” retorted Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I wouldn't dare tell you. But, Bern, do you want me to turn into a\n",
       "rabbit?”\n",
       "\n",
       "There was a dark-blue, merry flashing of eyes and a parting of lips;\n",
       "then she laughed. In that moment she was naive and wholesome.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Rabbit seems to agree with you,” replied Venters. “You are well and\n",
       "strong--and growing very pretty.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Anything in the nature of compliment he had never before said to her,\n",
       "and just now he responded to a sudden curiosity to see its effect. Bess\n",
       "stared as if she had not heard aright, slowly blushed, and completely\n",
       "lost her poise in happy confusion.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'd better go right away,” he continued, “and fetch supplies from\n",
       "Cottonwoods.”\n",
       "\n",
       "A startlingly swift change in the nature of her agitation made him\n",
       "reproach himself for his abruptness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, no, don't go!” she said. “I didn't mean--that about the rabbit.\n",
       "I--I was only trying to be--funny. Don't leave me all alone!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess, I must go sometime.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Wait then. Wait till after the storms.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The purple cloud-bank darkened the lower edge of the setting sun, crept\n",
       "up and up, obscuring its fiery red heart, and finally passed over the\n",
       "last ruddy crescent of its upper rim.\n",
       "\n",
       "The intense dead silence awakened to a long, low, rumbling roll of\n",
       "thunder.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh!” cried Bess, nervously.\n",
       "\n",
       "“We've had big black clouds before this without rain,” said Venters.\n",
       "“But there's no doubt about that thunder. The storms are coming. I'm\n",
       "glad. Every rider on the sage will hear that thunder with glad ears.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters and Bess finished their simple meal and the few tasks around the\n",
       "camp, then faced the open terrace, the valley, and the west, to watch\n",
       "and await the approaching storm.\n",
       "\n",
       "It required keen vision to see any movement whatever in the purple\n",
       "clouds. By infinitesimal degrees the dark cloud-line merged upward into\n",
       "the golden-red haze of the afterglow of sunset. A shadow lengthened from\n",
       "under the western wall across the valley. As straight and rigid as steel\n",
       "rose the delicate spear-pointed silver spruces; the aspen leaves, by\n",
       "nature pendant and quivering, hung limp and heavy; no slender blade\n",
       "of grass moved. A gentle splashing of water came from the ravine. Then\n",
       "again from out of the west sounded the low, dull, and rumbling roll of\n",
       "thunder.\n",
       "\n",
       "A wave, a ripple of light, a trembling and turning of the aspen leaves,\n",
       "like the approach of a breeze on the water, crossed the valley from the\n",
       "west; and the lull and the deadly stillness and the sultry air passed\n",
       "away on a cool wind.\n",
       "\n",
       "The night bird of the canyon, with clear and melancholy notes announced\n",
       "the twilight. And from all along the cliffs rose the faint murmur and\n",
       "moan and mourn of the wind singing in the caves. The bank of clouds now\n",
       "swept hugely out of the western sky. Its front was purple and black,\n",
       "with gray between, a bulging, mushrooming, vast thing instinct with\n",
       "storm. It had a dark, angry, threatening aspect. As if all the power of\n",
       "the winds were pushing and piling behind, it rolled ponderously across\n",
       "the sky. A red flare burned out instantaneously, flashed from the west\n",
       "to east, and died. Then from the deepest black of the purple cloud burst\n",
       "a boom. It was like the bowling of a huge boulder along the crags and\n",
       "ramparts, and seemed to roll on and fall into the valley to bound and\n",
       "bang and boom from cliff to cliff.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh!” cried Bess, with her hands over her ears. “What did I tell you?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why, Bess, be reasonable!” said Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm a coward.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Not quite that, I hope. It's strange you're afraid. I love a storm.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I tell you a storm down in these canyons is an awful thing. I know\n",
       "Oldring hated storms. His men were afraid of them. There was one who\n",
       "went deaf in a bad storm, and never could hear again.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Maybe I've lots to learn, Bess. I'll lose my guess if this storm isn't\n",
       "bad enough. We're going to have heavy wind first, then lightning and\n",
       "thunder, then the rain. Let's stay out as long as we can.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The tips of the cottonwoods and the oaks waved to the east, and the\n",
       "rings of aspens along the terraces twinkled their myriad of bright faces\n",
       "in fleet and glancing gleam. A low roar rose from the leaves of the\n",
       "forest, and the spruces swished in the rising wind. It came in gusts,\n",
       "with light breezes between. As it increased in strength the lulls\n",
       "shortened in length till there was a strong and steady blow all the\n",
       "time, and violent puffs at intervals, and sudden whirling currents. The\n",
       "clouds spread over the valley, rolling swiftly and low, and twilight\n",
       "faded into a sweeping darkness. Then the singing of the wind in the\n",
       "caves drowned the swift roar of rustling leaves; then the song swelled\n",
       "to a mourning, moaning wail; then with the gathering power of the\n",
       "wind the wail changed to a shriek. Steadily the wind strengthened and\n",
       "constantly the strange sound changed.\n",
       "\n",
       "The last bit of blue sky yielded to the on-sweep of clouds. Like angry\n",
       "surf the pale gleams of gray, amid the purple of that scudding front,\n",
       "swept beyond the eastern rampart of the valley. The purple deepened to\n",
       "black. Broad sheets of lightning flared over the western wall. There\n",
       "were not yet any ropes or zigzag streaks darting down through the\n",
       "gathering darkness. The storm center was still beyond Surprise Valley.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Listen!... Listen!” cried Bess, with her lips close to Venters's ear.\n",
       "“You'll hear Oldring's knell!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What's that?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oldring's knell. When the wind blows a gale in the caves it makes what\n",
       "the rustlers call Oldring's knell. They believe it bodes his death.\n",
       "I think he believes so, too. It's not like any sound on earth.... It's\n",
       "beginning. Listen!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The gale swooped down with a hollow unearthly howl. It yelled and pealed\n",
       "and shrilled and shrieked. It was made up of a thousand piercing cries.\n",
       "It was a rising and a moving sound. Beginning at the western break of\n",
       "the valley, it rushed along each gigantic cliff, whistling into the\n",
       "caves and cracks, to mount in power, to bellow a blast through the great\n",
       "stone bridge. Gone, as into an engulfing roar of surging waters, it\n",
       "seemed to shoot back and begin all over again.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was only wind, thought Venters. Here sped and shrieked the sculptor\n",
       "that carved out the wonderful caves in the cliffs. It was only a gale,\n",
       "but as Venters listened, as his ears became accustomed to the fury and\n",
       "strife, out of it all or through it or above it pealed low and perfectly\n",
       "clear and persistently uniform a strange sound that had no counterpart\n",
       "in all the sounds of the elements. It was not of earth or of life. It\n",
       "was the grief and agony of the gale. A knell of all upon which it blew!\n",
       "\n",
       "Black night enfolded the valley. Venters could not see his companion,\n",

       "on his arm. He felt the dogs huddle closer to him. Suddenly the dense,\n",
       "black vault overhead split asunder to a blue-white, dazzling streak of\n",
       "lightning. The whole valley lay vividly clear and luminously bright in\n",
       "his sight. Upreared, vast and magnificent, the stone bridge glimmered\n",
       "like some grand god of storm in the lightning's fire. Then all flashed\n",
       "black again--blacker than pitch--a thick, impenetrable coal-blackness.\n",
       "And there came a ripping, crashing report. Instantly an echo resounded\n",
       "with clapping crash. The initial report was nothing to the echo. It was\n",
       "a terrible, living, reverberating, detonating crash. The wall threw the\n",
       "sound across, and could have made no greater roar if it had slipped\n",
       "in avalanche. From cliff to cliff the echo went in crashing retort and\n",
       "banged in lessening power, and boomed in thinner volume, and clapped\n",
       "weaker and weaker till a final clap could not reach across the waiting\n",

       "a blinding flash of lightning illumined the cave and all about him. He\n",
       "saw Bess's face white now with dark, frightened eyes. He saw the dogs\n",
       "leap up, and he followed suit. The golden glare vanished; all was black;\n",
       "then came the splitting crack and the infernal din of echoes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bess shrank closer to him and closer, found his hands, and pressed them\n",
       "tightly over her ears, and dropped her face upon his shoulder, and hid\n",
       "her eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then the storm burst with a succession of ropes and streaks and shafts\n",
       "of lightning, playing continuously, filling the valley with a broken\n",
       "radiance; and the cracking shots followed each other swiftly till the\n",
       "echoes blended in one fearful, deafening crash.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters looked out upon the beautiful valley--beautiful now as never\n",
       "before--mystic in its transparent, luminous gloom, weird in the\n",
       "quivering, golden haze of lightning. The dark spruces were tipped with\n",
       "glimmering lights; the aspens bent low in the winds, as waves in a\n",
       "tempest at sea; the forest of oaks tossed wildly and shone with gleams\n",
       "of fire. Across the valley the huge cavern of the cliff-dwellers yawned\n",
       "in the glare, every little black window as clear as at noonday; but the\n",
       "night and the storm added to their tragedy. Flung arching to the black\n",
       "clouds, the great stone bridge seemed to bear the brunt of the storm. It\n",
       "caught the full fury of the rushing wind. It lifted its noble crown to\n",
       "meet the lightnings. Venters thought of the eagles and their lofty nest\n",
       "in a niche under the arch. A driving pall of rain, black as the clouds,\n",
       "came sweeping on to obscure the bridge and the gleaming walls and the\n",
       "shining valley. The lightning played incessantly, streaking down through\n",
       "opaque darkness of rain. The roar of the wind, with its strange knell\n",
       "and the re-crashing echoes, mingled with the roar of the flooding rain,\n",
       "and all seemingly were deadened and drowned in a world of sound.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the dimming pale light Venters looked down upon the girl. She had\n",
       "sunk into his arms, upon his breast, burying her face. She clung to him.\n",
       "He felt the softness of her, and the warmth, and the quick heave of her\n",
       "breast. He saw the dark, slender, graceful outline of her form. A woman\n",
       "lay in his arms! And he held her closer. He who had been alone in the\n",
       "sad, silent watches of the night was not now and never must be again\n",
       "alone. He who had yearned for the touch of a hand felt the long tremble\n",
       "and the heart-beat of a woman. By what strange chance had she come to\n",
       "love him! By what change--by what marvel had she grown into a treasure!\n",
       "\n",
       "No more did he listen to the rush and roar of the thunder-storm.\n",
       "For with the touch of clinging hands and the throbbing bosom he grew\n",
       "conscious of an inward storm--the tingling of new chords of thought,\n",
       "strange music of unheard, joyous bells sad dreams dawning to wakeful\n",
       "delight, dissolving doubt, resurging hope, force, fire, and freedom,\n",

       "he fell asleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "With the breaking of dawn his eyes unclosed. The valley lay drenched\n",
       "and bathed, a burnished oval of glittering green. The rain-washed walls\n",
       "glistened in the morning light. Waterfalls of many forms poured over\n",
       "the rims. One, a broad, lacy sheet, thin as smoke, slid over the western\n",
       "notch and struck a ledge in its downward fall, to bound into broader\n",
       "leap, to burst far below into white and gold and rosy mist.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters prepared for the day, knowing himself a different man.\n",

       "“It's a glorious morning,” said Bess, in greeting.\n",

       "“Yes. After the storm the west wind,” he replied.\n",

       "“Last night was I--very much of a baby?” she asked, watching him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Pretty much.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, I couldn't help it!”\n",

       "camp-fire and through the morning meal he was silent; afterward he\n",
       "strolled thoughtfully off alone along the terrace. He climbed a great\n",
       "yellow rock raising its crest among the spruces, and there he sat down\n",
       "to face the valley and the west.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I love her!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Aloud he spoke--unburdened his heart--confessed his secret. For an\n",
       "instant the golden valley swam before his eyes, and the walls waved, and\n",
       "all about him whirled with tumult within.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I love her!... I understand now.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Reviving memory of Jane Withersteen and thought of the complications of\n",
       "the present amazed him with proof of how far he had drifted from his\n",
       "old life. He discovered that he hated to take up the broken threads, to\n",
       "delve into dark problems and difficulties. In this beautiful valley he\n",
       "had been living a beautiful dream. Tranquillity had come to him, and the\n",
       "joy of solitude, and interest in all the wild creatures and crannies of\n",
       "this incomparable valley--and love. Under the shadow of the great stone\n",
       "bridge God had revealed Himself to Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“The world seems very far away,” he muttered, “but it's there--and I'm\n",
       "not yet done with it. Perhaps I never shall be.... Only--how glorious it\n",
       "would be to live here always and never think again!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Whereupon the resurging reality of the present, as if in irony of his\n",
       "wish, steeped him instantly in contending thought. Out of it all he\n",
       "presently evolved these things: he must go to Cottonwoods; he must bring\n",
       "supplies back to Surprise Valley; he must cultivate the soil and raise\n",
       "corn and stock, and, most imperative of all, he must decide the future\n",
       "of the girl who loved him and whom he loved. The first of these things\n",
       "required tremendous effort, the last one, concerning Bess, seemed simply\n",
       "and naturally easy of accomplishment. He would marry her. Suddenly, as\n",
       "from roots of poisonous fire, flamed up the forgotten truth concerning\n",
       "her. It seemed to wither and shrivel up all his joy on its hot, tearing\n",
       "way to his heart. She had been Oldring's Masked Rider. To Venters's\n",
       "question, “What were you to Oldring?” she had answered with scarlet\n",
       "shame and drooping head.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What do I care who she is or what she was!” he cried, passionately. And\n",
       "he knew it was not his old self speaking. It was this softer, gentler\n",
       "man who had awakened to new thoughts in the quiet valley. Tenderness,\n",
       "masterful in him now, matched the absence of joy and blunted the\n",
       "knife-edge of entering jealousy. Strong and passionate effort of will,\n",
       "surprising to him, held back the poison from piercing his soul.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Wait!... Wait!” he cried, as if calling. His hand pressed his breast,\n",
       "and he might have called to the pang there. “Wait! It's all so\n",
       "strange--so wonderful. Anything can happen. Who am I to judge her? I'll\n",
       "glory in my love for her. But I can't tell it--can't give up to it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Certainly he could not then decide her future. Marrying her was\n",
       "impossible in Surprise Valley and in any village south of Sterling. Even\n",
       "without the mask she had once worn she would easily have been recognized\n",
       "as Oldring's Rider. No man who had ever seen her would forget her,\n",
       "regardless of his ignorance as to her sex. Then more poignant than all\n",
       "other argument was the fact that he did not want to take her away from\n",
       "Surprise Valley. He resisted all thought of that. He had brought her to\n",
       "the most beautiful and wildest place of the uplands; he had saved her,\n",
       "nursed her back to strength, watched her bloom as one of the valley\n",
       "lilies; he knew her life there to be pure and sweet--she belonged to\n",
       "him, and he loved her. Still these were not all the reasons why he\n",
       "did not want to take her away. Where could they go? He feared the\n",
       "rustlers--he feared the riders--he feared the Mormons. And if he should\n",
       "ever succeed in getting Bess safely away from these immediate perils, he\n",
       "feared the sharp eyes of women and their tongues, the big outside world\n",
       "with its problems of existence. He must wait to decide her future,\n",
       "which, after all, was deciding his own. But between her future and his\n",
       "something hung impending. Like Balancing Rock, which waited darkly over\n",
       "the steep gorge, ready to close forever the outlet to Deception Pass,\n",
       "that nameless thing, as certain yet intangible as fate, must fall and\n",
       "close forever all doubts and fears of the future.\n",
       "\n",

       "climes, of sunshine asleep on other walls--of other places where reigned\n",
       "peace. It carried, too, sad truth of human hearts and mystery--of\n",

       "\n",
       "In the cloudy, threatening, waning summer days shadows lengthened\n",
       "down the sage-slope, and Jane Withersteen likened them to the shadows\n",
       "gathering and closing in around her life.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Larkin died, and little Fay was left an orphan with no known\n",
       "relative. Jane's love redoubled. It was the saving brightness of a\n",
       "darkening hour. Fay turned now to Jane in childish worship. And Jane\n",
       "at last found full expression for the mother-longing in her heart. Upon\n",
       "Lassiter, too, Mrs. Larkin's death had some subtle reaction. Before,\n",
       "he had often, without explanation, advised Jane to send Fay back to any\n",
       "Gentile family that would take her in. Passionately and reproachfully\n",
       "and wonderingly Jane had refused even to entertain such an idea. And\n",
       "now Lassiter never advised it again, grew sadder and quieter in his\n",
       "contemplation of the child, and infinitely more gentle and loving.\n",
       "Sometimes Jane had a cold, inexplicable sensation of dread when she saw\n",
       "Lassiter watching Fay. What did the rider see in the future? Why did he,\n",
       "day by day, grow more silent, calmer, cooler, yet sadder in prophetic\n",
       "assurance of something to be?\n",
       "\n",
       "No doubt, Jane thought, the rider, in his almost superhuman power of\n",
       "foresight, saw behind the horizon the dark, lengthening shadows that\n",
       "were soon to crowd and gloom over him and her and little Fay. Jane\n",
       "Withersteen awaited the long-deferred breaking of the storm with a\n",
       "courage and embittered calm that had come to her in her extremity. Hope\n",
       "had not died. Doubt and fear, subservient to her will, no longer gave\n",
       "her sleepless nights and tortured days. Love remained. All that she had\n",
       "loved she now loved the more. She seemed to feel that she was defiantly\n",
       "flinging the wealth of her love in the face of misfortune and of\n",
       "hate. No day passed but she prayed for all--and most fervently for her\n",
       "enemies. It troubled her that she had lost, or had never gained,\n",
       "the whole control of her mind. In some measure reason and wisdom and\n",
       "decision were locked in a chamber of her brain, awaiting a key. Power\n",
       "to think of some things was taken from her. Meanwhile, abiding a day of\n",
       "judgment, she fought ceaselessly to deny the bitter drops in her cup,\n",
       "to tear back the slow, the intangibly slow growth of a hot, corrosive\n",
       "lichen eating into her heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the morning of August 10th, Jane, while waiting in the court for\n",
       "Lassiter, heard a clear, ringing report of a rifle. It came from the\n",
       "grove, somewhere toward the corrals. Jane glanced out in alarm. The day\n",
       "was dull, windless, soundless. The leaves of the cottonwoods drooped, as\n",
       "if they had foretold the doom of Withersteen House and were now ready to\n",
       "die and drop and decay. Never had Jane seen such shade. She pondered\n",
       "on the meaning of the report. Revolver shots had of late cracked from\n",
       "different parts of the grove--spies taking snap-shots at Lassiter from\n",
       "a cowardly distance! But a rifle report meant more. Riders seldom used\n",
       "rifles. Judkins and Venters were the exceptions she called to mind. Had\n",
       "the men who hounded her hidden in her grove, taken to the rifle to rid\n",
       "her of Lassiter, her last friend? It was probable--it was likely. And\n",
       "she did not share his cool assumption that his death would never come at\n",
       "the hands of a Mormon. Long had she expected it. His constancy to\n",
       "her, his singular reluctance to use the fatal skill for which he was\n",
       "famed--both now plain to all Mormons--laid him open to inevitable\n",
       "assassination. Yet what charm against ambush and aim and enemy he\n",
       "seemed to bear about him! No, Jane reflected, it was not charm; only\n",
       "a wonderful training of eye and ear, and sense of impending peril.\n",
       "Nevertheless that could not forever avail against secret attack.\n",
       "\n",
       "That moment a rustling of leaves attracted her attention; then the\n",
       "familiar clinking accompaniment of a slow, soft, measured step, and\n",
       "Lassiter walked into the court.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, there's a fellow out there with a long gun,” he said, and,\n",
       "removing his sombrero, showed his head bound in a bloody scarf.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I heard the shot; I knew it was meant for you. Let me see--you can't be\n",
       "badly injured?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon not. But mebbe it wasn't a close call!... I'll sit here in this\n",
       "corner where nobody can see me from the grove.” He untied the scarf and\n",
       "removed it to show a long, bleeding furrow above his left temple.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's only a cut,” said Jane. “But how it bleeds! Hold your scarf over\n",
       "it just a moment till I come back.”\n",
       "\n",
       "She ran into the house and returned with bandages; and while she bathed\n",
       "and dressed the wound Lassiter talked.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That fellow had a good chance to get me. But he must have flinched when\n",
       "he pulled the trigger. As I dodged down I saw him run through the trees.\n",
       "He had a rifle. I've been expectin' that kind of gun play. I reckon now\n",
       "I'll have to keep a little closer hid myself. These fellers all seem to\n",
       "get chilly or shaky when they draw a bead on me, but one of them might\n",
       "jest happen to hit me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Won't you go away--leave Cottonwoods as I've begged you to--before some\n",
       "one does happen to hit you?” she appealed to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon I'll stay.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“But, oh, Lassiter--your blood will be on my hands!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“See here, lady, look at your hands now, right now. Aren't they fine,\n",
       "firm, white hands? Aren't they bloody now? Lassiter's blood! That's a\n",
       "queer thing to stain your beautiful hands. But if you could only see\n",
       "deeper you'd find a redder color of blood. Heart color, Jane!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh!... My friend!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, Jane, I'm not one to quit when the game grows hot, no more than\n",
       "you. This game, though, is new to me, an' I don't know the moves yet,\n",
       "else I wouldn't have stepped in front of that bullet.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Have you no desire to hunt the man who fired at you--to find\n",
       "him--and--and kill him?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, I reckon I haven't any great hankerin' for that.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, the wonder of it!... I knew--I prayed--I trusted. Lassiter, I almost\n",
       "gave--all myself to soften you to Mormons. Thank God, and thank you, my\n",
       "friend.... But, selfish woman that I am, this is no great test. What's\n",
       "the life of one of those sneaking cowards to such a man as you? I think\n",
       "of your great hate toward him who--I think of your life's implacable\n",
       "purpose. Can it be--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Wait!... Listen!” he whispered. “I hear a hoss.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He rose noiselessly, with his ear to the breeze. Suddenly he pulled his\n",
       "sombrero down over his bandaged head and, swinging his gun-sheaths round\n",
       "in front, he stepped into the alcove.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's a hoss--comin' fast,” he added.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane's listening ear soon caught a faint, rapid, rhythmic beat of hoofs.\n",
       "It came from the sage. It gave her a thrill that she was at a loss to\n",
       "understand. The sound rose stronger, louder. Then came a clear, sharp\n",
       "difference when the horse passed from the sage trail to the hard-packed\n",
       "ground of the grove. It became a ringing run--swift in its bell-like\n",
       "clatterings, yet singular in longer pause than usual between the\n",
       "hoofbeats of a horse.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's Wrangle!... It's Wrangle!” cried Jane Withersteen. “I'd know him\n",
       "from a million horses!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Excitement and thrilling expectancy flooded out all Jane Withersteen's\n",
       "calm. A tight band closed round her breast as she saw the giant sorrel\n",
       "flit in reddish-brown flashes across the openings in the green. Then\n",
       "he was pounding down the lane--thundering into the court--crashing his\n",
       "great iron-shod hoofs on the stone flags. Wrangle it was surely, but\n",
       "shaggy and wild-eyed, and sage-streaked, with dust-caked lather staining\n",
       "his flanks. He reared and crashed down and plunged. The rider leaped\n",
       "off, threw the bridle, and held hard on a lasso looped round Wrangle's\n",
       "head and neck. Janet's heart sank as she tried to recognize Venters in\n",
       "the rider. Something familiar struck her in the lofty stature in the\n",
       "sweep of powerful shoulders. But this bearded, longhaired, unkempt man,\n",
       "who wore ragged clothes patched with pieces of skin, and boots that\n",
       "showed bare legs and feet--this dusty, dark, and wild rider could not\n",
       "possibly be Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Whoa, Wrangle, old boy! Come down. Easy now. So--so--so. You're home,\n",
       "old boy, and presently you can have a drink of water you'll remember.”\n",
       "\n",
       "In the voice Jane knew the rider to be Venters. He tied Wrangle to the\n",
       "hitching-rack and turned to the court.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, Bern!... You wild man!” she exclaimed.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane--Jane, it's good to see you! Hello, Lassiter! Yes, it's Venters.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Like rough iron his hard hand crushed Jane's. In it she felt the\n",
       "difference she saw in him. Wild, rugged, unshorn--yet how splendid! He\n",
       "had gone away a boy--he had returned a man. He appeared taller, wider of\n",
       "shoulder, deeper-chested, more powerfully built. But was that only her\n",
       "fancy--he had always been a young giant--was the change one of spirit?\n",
       "He might have been absent for years, proven by fire and steel, grown\n",
       "like Lassiter, strong and cool and sure. His eyes--were they keener,\n",
       "more flashing than before?--met hers with clear, frank, warm regard, in\n",
       "which perplexity was not, nor discontent, nor pain.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Look at me long as you like,” he said, with a laugh. “I'm not much to\n",
       "look at. And, Jane, neither you nor Lassiter, can brag. You're paler\n",
       "than I ever saw you. Lassiter, here, he wears a bloody bandage under\n",
       "his hat. That reminds me. Some one took a flying shot at me down in the\n",
       "sage. It made Wrangle run some.... Well, perhaps you've more to tell me\n",
       "than I've got to tell you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Briefly, in few words, Jane outlined the circumstances of her undoing in\n",
       "the weeks of his absence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Under his beard and bronze she saw his face whiten in terrible wrath.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "No time in the long period of fiery moments and sudden shocks had Jane\n",

       "\n",
       "“Jane had gloom enough without my addin' to it by shootin' up the\n",
       "village,” he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "As strange as Lassiter's coolness was Venters's curious, intent scrutiny\n",
       "of them both, and under it Jane felt a flaming tide wave from bosom to\n",
       "temples.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well--you're right,” he said, with slow pause. “It surprises me a\n",
       "little, that's all.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane sensed then a slight alteration in Venters, and what it was, in her\n",
       "own confusion, she could not tell. It had always been her intention\n",
       "to acquaint him with the deceit she had fallen to in her zeal to move\n",
       "Lassiter. She did not mean to spare herself. Yet now, at the moment,\n",
       "before these riders, it was an impossibility to explain.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters was speaking somewhat haltingly, without his former frankness.\n",
       "“I found Oldring's hiding-place and your red herd. I learned--I\n",
       "know--I'm sure there was a deal between Tull and Oldring.” He paused\n",
       "and shifted his position and his gaze. He looked as if he wanted to say\n",
       "something that he found beyond him. Sorrow and pity and shame seemed\n",
       "to contend for mastery over him. Then he raised himself and spoke with\n",
       "effort. “Jane I've cost you too much. You've almost ruined yourself\n",
       "for me. It was wrong, for I'm not worth it. I never deserved such\n",
       "friendship. Well, maybe it's not too late. You must give me up. Mind,\n",
       "I haven't changed. I am just the same as ever. I'll see Tull while I'm\n",
       "here, and tell him to his face.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern, it's too late,” said Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'll make him believe!” cried Venters, violently.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You ask me to break our friendship?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes. If you don't, I shall.”\n",

       "“Forever?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Forever!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane sighed. Another shadow had lengthened down the sage slope to\n",
       "cast further darkness upon her. A melancholy sweetness pervaded her\n",
       "resignation. The boy who had left her had returned a man, nobler,\n",
       "stronger, one in whom she divined something unbending as steel. There\n",
       "might come a moment later when she would wonder why she had not fought\n",
       "against his will, but just now she yielded to it. She liked him as\n",
       "well--nay, more, she thought, only her emotions were deadened by the\n",
       "long, menacing wait for the bursting storm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once before she had held out her hand to him--when she gave it; now she\n",
       "stretched it tremblingly forth in acceptance of the decree circumstance\n",
       "had laid upon them. Venters bowed over it kissed it, pressed it hard,\n",
       "and half stifled a sound very like a sob. Certain it was that when he\n",
       "raised his head tears glistened in his eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Some--women--have a hard lot,” he said, huskily. Then he shook his\n",
       "powerful form, and his rags lashed about him. “I'll say a few things to\n",
       "Tull--when I meet him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern--you'll not draw on Tull? Oh, that must not be! Promise me--”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“I'll--say no more,” she faltered.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, Lassiter once called you blind,” said Venters. “It must be true.\n",
       "But I won't upbraid you. Only don't rouse the devil in me by praying for\n",
       "Tull! I'll try to keep cool when I meet him. That's all. Now there's one\n",
       "more thing I want to ask of you--the last. I've found a valley down in\n",
       "the Pass. It's a wonderful place. I intend to stay there. It's so hidden\n",
       "I believe no one can find it. There's good water, and browse, and game.\n",
       "I want to raise corn and stock. I need to take in supplies. Will you\n",
       "give them to me?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Assuredly. The more you take the better you'll please me--and perhaps\n",

       "\n",
       "“Mebbe that wouldn't be best. You'd sure be stopped. You'd better go\n",
       "early in the mornin'--say, just after dawn. That's the safest time to\n",
       "move round here.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, I'll be hard to stop,” returned Venters, darkly.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“Bern,” said Jane, “go first to the riders' quarters and get yourself a\n",
       "complete outfit. You're a--a sight. Then help yourself to whatever else\n",
       "you need--burros, packs, grain, dried fruits, and meat. You must take\n",
       "coffee and sugar and flour--all kinds of supplies. Don't forget corn and\n",
       "seeds. I remember how you used to starve. Please--please take all you\n",
       "can pack away from here. I'll make a bundle for you, which you mustn't\n",
       "open till you're in your valley. How I'd like to see it! To judge by you\n",
       "and Wrangle, how wild it must be!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane walked down into the outer court and approached the sorrel.\n",

       "\n",
       "“Wrangle--dear old Wrangle,” she said, and put a caressing hand on his\n",
       "matted mane. “Oh, he's wild, but he knows me! Bern, can he run as fast\n",
       "as ever?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Run? Jane, he's done sixty miles since last night at dark, and I could\n",
       "make him kill Black Star right now in a ten-mile race.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“He never could,” protested Jane. “He couldn't even if he was fresh.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon mebbe the best hoss'll prove himself yet,” said Lassiter,\n",
       "“an', Jane, if it ever comes to that race I'd like you to be on\n",
       "Wrangle.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'd like that, too,” rejoined Venters. “But, Jane, maybe Lassiter's\n",
       "hint is extreme. Bad as your prospects are, you'll surely never come to\n",
       "the running point.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Who knows!” she replied, with mournful smile.\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, no, Jane, it can't be so bad as all that. Soon as I see Tull\n",
       "there'll be a change in your fortunes. I'll hurry down to the\n",
       "village.... Now don't worry.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane retired to the seclusion of her room. Lassiter's subtle forecasting\n",
       "of disaster, Venters's forced optimism, neither remained in mind.\n",
       "Material loss weighed nothing in the balance with other losses she\n",
       "was sustaining. She wondered dully at her sitting there, hands folded\n",
       "listlessly, with a kind of numb deadness to the passing of time and the\n",
       "passing of her riches. She thought of Venters's friendship. She had not\n",
       "lost that, but she had lost him. Lassiter's friendship--that was more\n",
       "than love--it would endure, but soon he, too, would be gone. Little\n",
       "Fay slept dreamlessly upon the bed, her golden curls streaming over the\n",
       "pillow. Jane had the child's worship. Would she lose that, too? And if\n",
       "she did, what then would be left? Conscience thundered at her that there\n",
       "was left her religion. Conscience thundered that she should be grateful\n",
       "on her knees for this baptism of fire; that through misfortune,\n",
       "sacrifice, and suffering her soul might be fused pure gold. But the old,\n",
       "spontaneous, rapturous spirit no more exalted her. She wanted to be a\n",
       "woman--not a martyr. Like the saint of old who mortified his flesh,\n",
       "Jane Withersteen had in her the temper for heroic martyrdom, if by\n",
       "sacrificing herself she could save the souls of others. But here the\n",
       "damnable verdict blistered her that the more she sacrificed herself the\n",
       "blacker grew the souls of her churchmen. There was something terribly\n",
       "wrong with her soul, something terribly wrong with her churchmen and her\n",
       "religion. In the whirling gulf of her thought there was yet one shining\n",
       "light to guide her, to sustain her in her hope; and it was that, despite\n",
       "her errors and her frailties and her blindness, she had one absolute and\n",
       "unfaltering hold on ultimate and supreme justice. That was love. “Love\n",
       "your enemies as yourself!” was a divine word, entirely free from any\n",
       "church or creed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane's meditations were disturbed by Lassiter's soft, tinkling step in\n",
       "the court. Always he wore the clinking spurs. Always he was in readiness\n",
       "to ride. She passed out and called him into the huge, dim hall.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I think you'll be safer here. The court is too open,” she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon,” replied Lassiter. “An' it's cooler here. The day's sure\n",
       "muggy. Well, I went down to the village with Venters.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Already! Where is he?” queried Jane, in quick amaze.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He's at the corrals. Blake's helpin' him get the burros an' packs\n",
       "ready. That Blake is a good fellow.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Did--did Bern meet Tull?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I guess he did,” answered Lassiter, and he laughed dryly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Tell me! Oh, you exasperate me! You're so cool, so calm! For Heaven's\n",
       "sake, tell me what happened!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“First time I've been in the village for weeks,” went on Lassiter,\n",
       "mildly. “I reckon there 'ain't been more of a show for a long time. Me\n",
       "an' Venters walkin' down the road! It was funny. I ain't sayin' anybody\n",
       "was particular glad to see us. I'm not much thought of hereabouts, an'\n",
       "Venters he sure looks like what you called him, a wild man. Well, there\n",
       "was some runnin' of folks before we got to the stores. Then everybody\n",
       "vamoosed except some surprised rustlers in front of a saloon. Venters\n",
       "went right in the stores an' saloons, an' of course I went along. I\n",
       "don't know which tickled me the most--the actions of many fellers we\n",
       "met, or Venters's nerve. Jane, I was downright glad to be along. You\n",
       "see that sort of thing is my element, an' I've been away from it for\n",
       "a spell. But we didn't find Tull in one of them places. Some Gentile\n",
       "feller at last told Venters he'd find Tull in that long buildin' next to\n",
       "Parsons's store. It's a kind of meetin'-room; and sure enough, when we\n",
       "peeped in, it was half full of men.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Venters yelled: 'Don't anybody pull guns! We ain't come for that!' Then\n",
       "he tramped in, an' I was some put to keep alongside him. There was a\n",
       "hard, scrapin' sound of feet, a loud cry, an' then some whisperin', an'\n",
       "after that stillness you could cut with a knife. Tull was there,\n",
       "an' that fat party who once tried to throw a gun on me, an' other\n",
       "important-lookin' men, en' that little frog-legged feller who was with\n",
       "Tull the day I rode in here. I wish you could have seen their faces,\n",
       "'specially Tull's an' the fat party's. But there ain't no use of me\n",
       "tryin' to tell you how they looked.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, Venters an' I stood there in the middle of the room with that\n",
       "batch of men all in front of us, en' not a blamed one of them winked an\n",
       "eyelash or moved a finger. It was natural, of course, for me to notice\n",
       "many of them packed guns. That's a way of mine, first noticin' them\n",
       "things. Venters spoke up, an' his voice sort of chilled an' cut, en' he\n",
       "told Tull he had a few things to say.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Here Lassiter paused while he turned his sombrero round and round, in\n",
       "his familiar habit, and his eyes had the look of a man seeing over again\n",
       "some thrilling spectacle, and under his red bronze there was strange\n",
       "animation.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Like a shot, then, Venters told Tull that the friendship between you\n",
       "an' him was all over, an' he was leaving your place. He said you'd\n",
       "both of you broken off in the hope of propitiatin' your people, but you\n",
       "hadn't changed your mind otherwise, an' never would.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Next he spoke up for you. I ain't goin' to tell you what he said.\n",
       "Only--no other woman who ever lived ever had such tribute! You had a\n",
       "champion, Jane, an' never fear that those thick-skulled men don't know\n",
       "you now. It couldn't be otherwise. He spoke the ringin', lightnin'\n",
       "truth.... Then he accused Tull of the underhand, miserable robbery of a\n",
       "helpless woman. He told Tull where the red herd was, of a deal made with\n",
       "Oldrin', that Jerry Card had made the deal. I thought Tull was goin' to\n",
       "drop, an' that little frog-legged cuss, he looked some limp an' white.\n",
       "But Venters's voice would have kept anybody's legs from bucklin'. I was\n",
       "stiff myself. He went on an' called Tull--called him every bad name ever\n",
       "known to a rider, an' then some. He cursed Tull. I never hear a man\n",
       "get such a cursin'. He laughed in scorn at the idea of Tull bein' a\n",
       "minister. He said Tull an' a few more dogs of hell builded their\n",
       "empire out of the hearts of such innocent an' God-fearin' women as Jane\n",
       "Withersteen. He called Tull a binder of women, a callous beast who hid\n",
       "behind a mock mantle of righteousness--an' the last an' lowest coward\n",
       "on the face of the earth. To prey on weak women through their\n",
       "religion--that was the last unspeakable crime!\n",
       "\n",
       "“Then he finished, an' by this time he'd almost lost his voice. But his\n",
       "whisper was enough. 'Tull,' he said, 'she begged me not to draw on you\n",
       "to-day. She would pray for you if you burned her at the stake.... But\n",
       "listen!... I swear if you and I ever come face to face again, I'll kill\n",
       "you!'\n",
       "\n",
       "“We backed out of the door then, an' up the road. But nobody follered\n",

       "\n",
       "Jane found herself weeping passionately. She had not been conscious of\n",
       "it till Lassiter ended his story, and she experienced exquisite pain and\n",
       "relief in shedding tears. Long had her eyes been dry, her grief deep;\n",
       "long had her emotions been dumb. Lassiter's story put her on the rack;\n",
       "the appalling nature of Venters's act and speech had no parallel as an\n",
       "outrage; it was worse than bloodshed. Men like Tull had been shot, but\n",
       "had one ever been so terribly denounced in public? Over-mounting her\n",
       "horror, an uncontrollable, quivering passion shook her very soul. It was\n",
       "sheer human glory in the deed of a fearless man. It was hot, primitive\n",
       "instinct to live--to fight. It was a kind of mad joy in Venters's\n",
       "chivalry. It was close to the wrath that had first shaken her in the\n",
       "beginning of this war waged upon her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, well, Jane, don't take it that way,” said Lassiter, in evident\n",
       "distress. “I had to tell you. There's some things a feller jest can't\n",
       "keep. It's strange you give up on hearin' that, when all this long time\n",
       "you've been the gamest woman I ever seen. But I don't know women. Mebbe\n",
       "there's reason for you to cry. I know this--nothin' ever rang in my soul\n",
       "an' so filled it as what Venters did. I'd like to have done it, but--I'm\n",
       "only good for throwin' a gun, en' it seems you hate that.... Well, I'll\n",

       "\n",
       "Jane passed the rest of that day in a vain endeavor to decide what and\n",
       "what not to put in the pack for Venters. This task was the last she\n",
       "would ever perform for him, and the gifts were the last she would ever\n",
       "make him. So she picked and chose and rejected, and chose again, and\n",
       "often paused in sad revery, and began again, till at length she filled\n",
       "the pack.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was about sunset, and she and Fay had finished supper and were\n",
       "sitting in the court, when Venters's quick steps rang on the stones.\n",
       "She scarcely knew him, for he had changed the tattered garments, and\n",
       "she missed the dark beard and long hair. Still he was not the Venters of\n",
       "old. As he came up the steps she felt herself pointing to the pack,\n",
       "and heard herself speaking words that were meaningless to her. He said\n",
       "good-by; he kissed her, released her, and turned away. His tall figure\n",
       "blurred in her sight, grew dim through dark, streaked vision, and then\n",
       "he vanished.\n",
       "\n",
       "Twilight fell around Withersteen House, and dusk and night. Little\n",
       "Fay slept; but Jane lay with strained, aching eyes. She heard the wind\n",
       "moaning in the cottonwoods and mice squeaking in the walls. The night\n",
       "was interminably long, yet she prayed to hold back the dawn. What would\n",
       "another day bring forth? The blackness of her room seemed blacker\n",
       "for the sad, entering gray of morning light. She heard the chirp of\n",
       "awakening birds, and fancied she caught a faint clatter of hoofs. Then\n",
       "low, dull distant, throbbed a heavy gunshot. She had expected it, was\n",
       "waiting for it; nevertheless, an electric shock checked her heart, froze\n",
       "the very living fiber of her bones. That vise-like hold on her faculties\n",
       "apparently did not relax for a long time, and it was a voice under her\n",
       "window that released her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane!... Jane!” softly called Lassiter.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "love.”\n",
       "\n",

       "As Lassiter had reported to Jane, Venters “went through” safely, and\n",
       "after a toilsome journey reached the peaceful shelter of Surprise\n",
       "Valley. When finally he lay wearily down under the silver spruces,\n",
       "resting from the strain of dragging packs and burros up the slope and\n",
       "through the entrance to Surprise Valley, he had leisure to think, and\n",
       "a great deal of the time went in regretting that he had not been frank\n",
       "with his loyal friend, Jane Withersteen.\n",
       "\n",
       "But, he kept continually recalling, when he had stood once more face to\n",
       "face with her and had been shocked at the change in her and had heard\n",
       "the details of her adversity, he had not had the heart to tell her of\n",
       "the closer interest which had entered his life. He had not lied; yet he\n",
       "had kept silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bess was in transports over the stores of supplies and the outfit he had\n",
       "packed from Cottonwoods. He had certainly brought a hundred times\n",
       "more than he had gone for; enough, surely, for years, perhaps to make\n",
       "permanent home in the valley. He saw no reason why he need ever leave\n",
       "there again.\n",
       "\n",
       "After a day of rest he recovered his strength and shared Bess's pleasure\n",
       "in rummaging over the endless packs, and began to plan for the future.\n",
       "And in this planning, his trip to Cottonwoods, with its revived hate\n",
       "of Tull and consequent unleashing of fierce passions, soon faded out\n",
       "of mind. By slower degrees his friendship for Jane Withersteen and his\n",
       "contrition drifted from the active preoccupation of his present thought\n",
       "to a place in memory, with more and more infrequent recalls.\n",
       "\n",
       "And as far as the state of his mind was concerned, upon the second day\n",
       "after his return, the valley, with its golden hues and purple shades,\n",
       "the speaking west wind and the cool, silent night, and Bess's watching\n",
       "eyes with their wonderful light, so wrought upon Venters that he might\n",
       "never have left them at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "That very afternoon he set to work. Only one thing hindered him upon\n",
       "beginning, though it in no wise checked his delight, and that in the\n",
       "multiplicity of tasks planned to make a paradise out of the valley he\n",
       "could not choose the one with which to begin. He had to grow into the\n",
       "habit of passing from one dreamy pleasure to another, like a bee going\n",
       "from flower to flower in the valley, and he found this wandering habit\n",
       "likely to extend to his labors. Nevertheless, he made a start.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the outset he discovered Bess to be both a considerable help in some\n",
       "ways and a very great hindrance in others. Her excitement and joy were\n",
       "spurs, inspirations; but she was utterly impracticable in her ideas,\n",
       "and she flitted from one plan to another with bewildering vacillation.\n",
       "Moreover, he fancied that she grew more eager, youthful, and sweet; and\n",
       "he marked that it was far easier to watch her and listen to her than\n",
       "it was to work. Therefore he gave her tasks that necessitated her going\n",
       "often to the cave where he had stored his packs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Upon the last of these trips, when he was some distance down the terrace\n",
       "and out of sight of camp, he heard a scream, and then the sharp barking\n",
       "of the dogs.\n",
       "\n",
       "For an instant he straightened up, amazed. Danger for her had been\n",
       "absolutely out of his mind. She had seen a rattlesnake--or a wildcat.\n",
       "Still she would not have been likely to scream at sight of either; and\n",
       "the barking of the dogs was ominous. Dropping his work, he dashed back\n",
       "along the terrace. Upon breaking through a clump of aspens he saw the\n",
       "dark form of a man in the camp. Cold, then hot, Venters burst into\n",
       "frenzied speed to reach his guns. He was cursing himself for a\n",
       "thoughtless fool when the man's tall form became familiar and he\n",
       "recognized Lassiter. Then the reversal of emotions changed his run to\n",
       "a walk; he tried to call out, but his voice refused to carry; when he\n",
       "reached camp there was Lassiter staring at the white-faced girl. By that\n",
       "time Ring and Whitie had recognized him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hello, Venters! I'm makin' you a visit,” said Lassiter, slowly. “An'\n",
       "I'm some surprised to see you've a--a young feller for company.”\n",
       "\n",
       "One glance had sufficed for the keen rider to read Bess's real sex, and\n",
       "for once his cool calm had deserted him. He stared till the white of\n",
       "Bess's cheeks flared into crimson. That, if it were needed, was the\n",
       "concluding evidence of her femininity, for it went fittingly with her\n",
       "sun-tinted hair and darkened, dilated eyes, the sweetness of her mouth,\n",
       "and the striking symmetry of her slender shape.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Heavens! Lassiter!” panted Venters, when he caught his breath. “What\n",
       "relief--it's only you! How--in the name of all that's wonderful--did you\n",
       "ever get here?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I trailed you. We--I wanted to know where you was, if you had a safe\n",
       "place. So I trailed you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Trailed me,” cried Venters, bluntly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon. It was some of a job after I got to them smooth rocks. I was\n",
       "all day trackin' you up to them little cut steps in the rock. The rest\n",
       "was easy.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Where's your hoss? I hope you hid him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I tied him in them queer cedars down on the slope. He can't be seen\n",
       "from the valley.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“That's good. Well, well! I'm completely dumfounded. It was my idea that\n",
       "no man could track me in here.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon. But if there's a tracker in these uplands as good as me he\n",
       "can find you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“That's bad. That'll worry me. But, Lassiter, now you're here I'm glad\n",
       "to see you. And--and my companion here is not a young fellow!... Bess,\n",
       "this is a friend of mine. He saved my life once.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The embarrassment of the moment did not extend to Lassiter. Almost at\n",
       "once his manner, as he shook hands with Bess, relieved Venters and put\n",
       "the girl at ease. After Venters's words and one quick look at Lassiter,\n",
       "her agitation stilled, and, though she was shy, if she were conscious\n",
       "of anything out of the ordinary in the situation, certainly she did not\n",
       "show it.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon I'll only stay a little while,” Lassiter was saying. “An' if\n",
       "you don't mind troublin', I'm hungry. I fetched some biscuits along, but\n",
       "they're gone. Venters, this place is sure the wonderfullest ever seen.\n",
       "Them cut steps on the slope! That outlet into the gorge! An' it's like\n",
       "climbin' up through hell into heaven to climb through that gorge into\n",
       "this valley! There's a queer-lookin' rock at the top of the passage. I\n",
       "didn't have time to stop. I'm wonderin' how you ever found this place.\n",
       "It's sure interestin'.”\n",
       "\n",
       "During the preparation and eating of dinner Lassiter listened mostly,\n",
       "as was his wont, and occasionally he spoke in his quaint and dry way.\n",
       "Venters noted, however, that the rider showed an increasing interest in\n",
       "Bess. He asked her no questions, and only directed his attention to her\n",
       "while she was occupied and had no opportunity to observe his scrutiny.\n",
       "It seemed to Venters that Lassiter grew more and more absorbed in his\n",
       "study of Bess, and that he lost his coolness in some strange, softening\n",
       "sympathy. Then, quite abruptly, he arose and announced the necessity\n",
       "for his early departure. He said good-by to Bess in a voice gentle and\n",
       "somewhat broken, and turned hurriedly away. Venters accompanied him, and\n",
       "they had traversed the terrace, climbed the weathered slope, and passed\n",
       "under the stone bridge before either spoke again.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Lassiter put a great hand on Venters's shoulder and wheeled him to\n",
       "meet a smoldering fire of gray eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, I couldn't tell Jane! I couldn't,” burst out Venters, reading\n",
       "his friend's mind. “I tried. But I couldn't. She wouldn't understand,\n",
       "and she has troubles enough. And I love the girl!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Venters, I reckon this beats me. I've seen some queer things in my\n",

       "\n",
       "“Don't know! What is she, then?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I don't know that, either. Oh, it's the strangest story you ever heard.\n",
       "I must tell you. But you'll never believe.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Venters, women were always puzzles to me. But for all that, if this\n",
       "girl ain't a child, an' as innocent, I'm no fit person to think of\n",
       "virtue an' goodness in anybody. Are you goin' to be square with her?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I am--so help me God!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckoned so. Mebbe my temper oughtn't led me to make sure. But, man,\n",
       "she's a woman in all but years. She's sweeter 'n the sage.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Lassiter, I know, I know. And the hell of it is that in spite of her\n",

       "\n",
       "“I wouldn't want to--of course, I couldn't call you a liar, Venters,”\n",

       "\n",
       "“What's more, she was Oldring's Masked Rider!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters expected to floor his friend with that statement, but he was not\n",
       "in any way prepared for the shock his words gave. For an instant he was\n",
       "astounded to see Lassiter stunned; then his own passionate eagerness\n",
       "to unbosom himself, to tell the wonderful story, precluded any other\n",
       "thought.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Son, tell me all about this,” presently said Lassiter as he seated\n",
       "himself on a stone and wiped his moist brow.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thereupon Venters began his narrative at the point where he had shot the\n",
       "rustler and Oldring's Masked Rider, and he rushed through it, telling\n",
       "all, not holding back even Bess's unreserved avowal of her love or his\n",
       "deepest emotions.\n",
       "\n",
       "“That's the story,” he said, concluding. “I love her, though I've never\n",
       "told her. If I did tell her I'd be ready to marry her, and that seems\n",
       "impossible in this country. I'd be afraid to risk taking her anywhere.\n",
       "So I intend to do the best I can for her here.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“The longer I live the stranger life is,” mused Lassiter, with downcast\n",
       "eyes. “I'm reminded of somethin' you once said to Jane about hands in\n",

       "In the further ascent Venters halted several times with the intention of\n",
       "saying good-by, yet he changed his mind and kept on climbing till they\n",
       "reached Balancing Rock. Lassiter examined the huge rock, listened to\n",

       "over my scare.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, you do seem uncommon nervous,” replied Lassiter, much amused.\n",
       "“Now, as for me, why I always had the funniest notion to roll stones!\n",
       "When I was a kid I did it, an' the bigger I got the bigger stones I'd\n",
       "roll. Ain't that funny? Honest--even now I often get off my hoss just to\n",

       "you get out of the valley below. The rustlers' canyon isn't more than\n",

       "pitch by the recital of his love story, quieted gradually, and in its\n",
       "place came a sober, thoughtful mood. All at once he saw that he was\n",
       "serious, because he would never more regain his sense of security while\n",
       "in the valley. What Lassiter could do another skilful tracker might\n",
       "duplicate. Among the many riders with whom Venters had ridden he\n",

       "followed it to the edge of the bare slope in the pass, let alone up that\n",
       "glistening smooth stone. Lassiter, however, was not an ordinary rider.\n",
       "Instead of hunting cattle tracks he had likely spent a goodly portion\n",
       "of his life tracking men. It was not improbable that among Oldring's\n",
       "rustlers there was one who shared Lassiter's gift for trailing. And the\n",
       "more Venters dwelt on this possibility the more perturbed he grew.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter's visit, moreover, had a disquieting effect upon Bess, and\n",
       "Venters fancied that she entertained the same thought as to future\n",
       "seclusion. The breaking of their solitude, though by a well-meaning\n",
       "friend, had not only dispelled all its dream and much of its charm, but\n",
       "had instilled a canker of fear. Both had seen the footprint in the sand.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters did no more work that day. Sunset and twilight gave way to\n",
       "night, and the canyon bird whistled its melancholy notes, and the wind\n",
       "sang softly in the cliffs, and the camp-fire blazed and burned down to\n",
       "red embers. To Venters a subtle difference was apparent in all of these,\n",
       "or else the shadowy change had been in him. He hoped that on the morrow\n",
       "this slight depression would have passed away.\n",
       "\n",
       "In that measure, however, he was doomed to disappointment. Furthermore,\n",
       "Bess reverted to a wistful sadness that he had not observed in her since\n",
       "her recovery. His attempt to cheer her out of it resulted in dismal\n",
       "failure, and consequently in a darkening of his own mood. Hard work\n",
       "relieved him; still, when the day had passed, his unrest returned.\n",
       "Then he set to deliberate thinking, and there came to him the startling\n",
       "conviction that he must leave Surprise Valley and take Bess with him.\n",
       "As a rider he had taken many chances, and as an adventurer in Deception\n",
       "Pass he had unhesitatingly risked his life, but now he would run no\n",
       "preventable hazard of Bess's safety and happiness, and he was too keen\n",
       "not to see that hazard. It gave him a pang to think of leaving the\n",
       "beautiful valley just when he had the means to establish a permanent\n",
       "and delightful home there. One flashing thought tore in hot temptation\n",
       "through his mind--why not climb up into the gorge, roll Balancing Rock\n",
       "down the trail, and close forever the outlet to Deception Pass? “That\n",
       "was the beast in me--showing his teeth!” muttered Venters, scornfully.\n",

       "\n",
       "Another day went by, in which he worked less and pondered more and\n",
       "all the time covertly watched Bess. Her wistfulness had deepened into\n",
       "downright unhappiness, and that made his task to tell her all the\n",
       "harder. He kept the secret another day, hoping by some chance she might\n",
       "grow less moody, and to his exceeding anxiety she fell into far deeper\n",
       "gloom. Out of his own secret and the torment of it he divined that she,\n",
       "too, had a secret and the keeping of it was torturing her. As yet he had\n",
       "no plan thought out in regard to how or when to leave the valley, but\n",
       "he decided to tell her the necessity of it and to persuade her to go.\n",

       "\n",

       "which was manifestly heavy. Upon nearer view he saw that whatever she\n",

       "“You're wrong. I worked. Look at my hands.” She dropped on her knees\n",
       "close to where he sat, and, carefully depositing the black bundle, she\n",

       "\n",

       "The plan eventually decided upon by the lovers was for Venters to go to\n",
       "the village, secure a horse and some kind of a disguise for Bess, or\n",
       "at least less striking apparel than her present garb, and to return\n",
       "post-haste to the valley. Meanwhile, she would add to their store of\n",
       "gold. Then they would strike the long and perilous trail to ride out of\n",
       "Utah. In the event of his inability to fetch back a horse for her, they\n",
       "intended to make the giant sorrel carry double. The gold, a little food,\n",
       "saddle blankets, and Venters's guns were to compose the light outfit\n",
       "with which they would make the start.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I love this beautiful place,” said Bess. “It's hard to think of leaving\n",
       "it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hard! Well, I should think so,” replied Venters. “Maybe--in years--”\n",
       " But he did not complete in words his thought that might be possible to\n",
       "return after many years of absence and change.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once again Bess bade Venters farewell under the shadow of Balancing\n",
       "Rock, and this time it was with whispered hope and tenderness and\n",
       "passionate trust. Long after he had left her, all down through the\n",
       "outlet to the Pass, the clinging clasp of her arms, the sweetness of\n",
       "her lips, and the sense of a new and exquisite birth of character in her\n",
       "remained hauntingly and thrillingly in his mind. The girl who had sadly\n",
       "called herself nameless and nothing had been marvelously transformed\n",
       "in the moment of his avowal of love. It was something to think over,\n",
       "something to warm his heart, but for the present it had absolutely to be\n",
       "forgotten so that all his mind could be addressed to the trip so fraught\n",
       "with danger.\n",
       "\n",
       "He carried only his rifle, revolver, and a small quantity of bread and\n",
       "meat, and thus lightly burdened, he made swift progress down the slope\n",
       "and out into the valley. Darkness was coming on, and he welcomed it.\n",
       "Stars were blinking when he reached his old hiding-place in the split of\n",
       "canyon wall, and by their aid he slipped through the dense thickets to\n",
       "the grassy enclosure. Wrangle stood in the center of it with his head\n",
       "up, and he appeared black and of gigantic proportions in the dim light.\n",
       "Venters whistled softly, began a slow approach, and then called. The\n",
       "horse snorted and, plunging away with dull, heavy sound of hoofs, he\n",
       "disappeared in the gloom. “Wilder than ever!” muttered Venters. He\n",
       "followed the sorrel into the narrowing split between the walls, and\n",
       "presently had to desist because he could not see a foot in advance. As\n",
       "he went back toward the open Wrangle jumped out of an ebony shadow of\n",
       "cliff and like a thunderbolt shot huge and black past him down into\n",
       "the starlit glade. Deciding that all attempts to catch Wrangle at night\n",
       "would be useless, Venters repaired to the shelving rock where he had\n",
       "hidden saddle and blanket, and there went to sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "The first peep of day found him stirring, and as soon as it was light\n",
       "enough to distinguish objects, he took his lasso off his saddle and went\n",
       "out to rope the sorrel. He espied Wrangle at the lower end of the cove\n",
       "and approached him in a perfectly natural manner. When he got near\n",
       "enough, Wrangle evidently recognized him, but was too wild to stand.\n",
       "He ran up the glade and on into the narrow lane between the walls. This\n",
       "favored Venters's speedy capture of the horse, so, coiling his noose\n",
       "ready to throw, he hurried on. Wrangle let Venters get to within a\n",
       "hundred feet and then he broke. But as he plunged by, rapidly getting\n",
       "into his stride, Venters made a perfect throw with the rope. He had\n",
       "time to brace himself for the shock; nevertheless, Wrangle threw him and\n",
       "dragged him several yards before halting.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You wild devil,” said Venters, as he slowly pulled Wrangle up. “Don't\n",
       "you know me? Come now--old fellow--so--so--”\n",
       "\n",
       "Wrangle yielded to the lasso and then to Venters's strong hand. He was\n",
       "as straggly and wild-looking as a horse left to roam free in the sage.\n",
       "He dropped his long ears and stood readily to be saddled and bridled.\n",
       "But he was exceedingly sensitive, and quivered at every touch and sound.\n",
       "Venters led him to the thicket, and, bending the close saplings to let\n",
       "him squeeze through, at length reached the open. Sharp survey in each\n",
       "direction assured him of the usual lonely nature of the canyon, then he\n",
       "was in the saddle, riding south.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wrangle's long, swinging canter was a wonderful ground-gainer. His\n",
       "stride was almost twice that of an ordinary horse; and his endurance was\n",
       "equally remarkable. Venters pulled him in occasionally, and walked him\n",
       "up the stretches of rising ground and along the soft washes. Wrangle\n",
       "had never yet shown any indication of distress while Venters rode him.\n",
       "Nevertheless, there was now reason to save the horse, therefore Venters\n",
       "did not resort to the hurry that had characterized his former trip.\n",
       "He camped at the last water in the Pass. What distance that was to\n",
       "Cottonwoods he did not know; he calculated, however, that it was in the\n",
       "neighborhood of fifty miles.\n",
       "\n",
       "Early in the morning he proceeded on his way, and about the middle of\n",
       "the forenoon reached the constricted gap that marked the southerly end\n",
       "of the Pass, and through which led the trail up to the sage-level. He\n",
       "spied out Lassiter's tracks in the dust, but no others, and dismounting,\n",
       "he straightened out Wrangle's bridle and began to lead him up the trail.\n",
       "The short climb, more severe on beast than on man, necessitated a rest\n",
       "on the level above, and during this he scanned the wide purple reaches\n",
       "of slope.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wrangle whistled his pleasure at the smell of the sage. Remounting,\n",
       "Venters headed up the white trail with the fragrant wind in his face. He\n",
       "had proceeded for perhaps a couple of miles when Wrangle stopped with a\n",
       "suddenness that threw Venters heavily against the pommel.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What's wrong, old boy?” called Venters, looking down for a loose shoe\n",
       "or a snake or a foot lamed by a picked-up stone. Unrewarded, he raised\n",
       "himself from his scrutiny. Wrangle stood stiff head high, with his\n",
       "long ears erect. Thus guided, Venters swiftly gazed ahead to make out a\n",
       "dust-clouded, dark group of horsemen riding down the slope. If they had\n",
       "seen him, it apparently made no difference in their speed or direction.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Wonder who they are!” exclaimed Venters. He was not disposed to run.\n",
       "His cool mood tightened under grip of excitement as he reflected that,\n",
       "whoever the approaching riders were, they could not be friends. He\n",
       "slipped out of the saddle and led Wrangle behind the tallest sage-brush.\n",
       "It might serve to conceal them until the riders were close enough for\n",
       "him to see who they were; after that he would be indifferent to how soon\n",
       "they discovered him.\n",
       "\n",
       "After looking to his rifle and ascertaining that it was in working\n",
       "order, he watched, and as he watched, slowly the force of a bitter\n",
       "fierceness, long dormant, gathered ready to flame into life. If those\n",
       "riders were not rustlers he had forgotten how rustlers looked and rode.\n",
       "On they came, a small group, so compact and dark that he could not tell\n",
       "their number. How unusual that their horses did not see Wrangle! But\n",
       "such failure, Venters decided, was owing to the speed with which they\n",
       "were traveling. They moved at a swift canter affected more by rustlers\n",
       "than by riders. Venters grew concerned over the possibility that these\n",
       "horsemen would actually ride down on him before he had a chance to\n",
       "tell what to expect. When they were within three hundred yards he\n",
       "deliberately led Wrangle out into the trail.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then he heard shouts, and the hard scrape of sliding hoofs, and saw\n",
       "horses rear and plunge back with up-flung heads and flying manes.\n",
       "Several little white puffs of smoke appeared sharply against the black\n",
       "background of riders and horses, and shots rang out. Bullets struck far\n",
       "in front of Venters, and whipped up the dust and then hummed low into\n",
       "the sage. The range was great for revolvers, but whether the shots were\n",
       "meant to kill or merely to check advance, they were enough to fire that\n",
       "waiting ferocity in Venters. Slipping his arm through the bridle, so\n",
       "that Wrangle could not get away, Venters lifted his rifle and pulled the\n",
       "trigger twice.\n",
       "\n",
       "He saw the first horseman lean sideways and fall. He saw another lurch\n",
       "in his saddle and heard a cry of pain. Then Wrangle, plunging in fright,\n",
       "lifted Venters and nearly threw him. He jerked the horse down with\n",
       "a powerful hand and leaped into the saddle. Wrangle plunged again,\n",
       "dragging his bridle, that Venters had not had time to throw in place.\n",
       "Bending over with a swift movement, he secured it and dropped the loop\n",
       "over the pommel. Then, with grinding teeth, he looked to see what the\n",
       "issue would be.\n",
       "\n",
       "The band had scattered so as not to afford such a broad mark for\n",
       "bullets. The riders faced Venters, some with red-belching guns. He heard\n",
       "a sharper report, and just as Wrangle plunged again he caught the whim\n",
       "of a leaden missile that would have hit him but for Wrangle's sudden\n",
       "jump. A swift, hot wave, turning cold, passed over Venters. Deliberately\n",
       "he picked out the one rider with a carbine, and killed him. Wrangle\n",
       "snorted shrilly and bolted into the sage. Venters let him run a few\n",
       "rods, then with iron arm checked him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Five riders, surely rustlers, were left. One leaped out of the saddle to\n",
       "secure his fallen comrade's carbine. A shot from Venters, which missed\n",
       "the man but sent the dust flying over him made him run back to his\n",
       "horse. Then they separated. The crippled rider went one way; the one\n",
       "frustrated in his attempt to get the carbine rode another, Venters\n",
       "thought he made out a third rider, carrying a strange-appearing bundle\n",
       "and disappearing in the sage. But in the rapidity of action and vision\n",
       "he could not discern what it was. Two riders with three horses swung\n",
       "out to the right. Afraid of the long rifle--a burdensome weapon seldom\n",
       "carried by rustlers or riders--they had been put to rout.\n",
       "\n",
       "Suddenly Venters discovered that one of the two men last noted was\n",
       "riding Jane Withersteen's horse Bells--the beautiful bay racer she had\n",
       "given to Lassiter. Venters uttered a savage outcry. Then the small,\n",
       "wiry, frog-like shape of the second rider, and the ease and grace of his\n",
       "seat in the saddle--things so strikingly incongruous--grew more and more\n",
       "familiar in Venters's sight.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jerry Card!” cried Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was indeed Tull's right-hand man. Such a white hot wrath inflamed\n",
       "Venters that he fought himself to see with clearer gaze.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It's Jerry Card!” he exclaimed, instantly. “And he's riding Black Star\n",
       "and leading Night!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The long-kindling, stormy fire in Venters's heart burst into flame. He\n",
       "spurred Wrangle, and as the horse lengthened his stride Venters slipped\n",
       "cartridges into the magazine of his rifle till it was once again full.\n",
       "Card and his companion were now half a mile or more in advance, riding\n",
       "easily down the slope. Venters marked the smooth gait, and understood it\n",
       "when Wrangle galloped out of the sage into the broad cattle trail,\n",
       "down which Venters had once tracked Jane Withersteen's red herd. This\n",
       "hard-packed trail, from years of use, was as clean and smooth as a road.\n",
       "Venters saw Jerry Card look back over his shoulder, the other rider did\n",
       "likewise. Then the three racers lengthened their stride to the point\n",
       "where the swinging canter was ready to break into a gallop.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Wrangle, the race's on,” said Venters, grimly. “We'll canter with them\n",
       "and gallop with them and run with them. We'll let them set the pace.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters knew he bestrode the strongest, swiftest, most tireless horse\n",
       "ever ridden by any rider across the Utah uplands. Recalling Jane\n",
       "Withersteen's devoted assurance that Night could run neck and neck with\n",
       "Wrangle, and Black Star could show his heels to him, Venters wished\n",
       "that Jane were there to see the race to recover her blacks and in the\n",
       "unqualified superiority of the giant sorrel. Then Venters found himself\n",
       "thankful that she was absent, for he meant that race to end in Jerry\n",
       "Card's death. The first flush, the raging of Venters's wrath, passed, to\n",
       "leave him in sullen, almost cold possession of his will. It was a deadly\n",
       "mood, utterly foreign to his nature, engendered, fostered, and released\n",
       "by the wild passions of wild men in a wild country. The strength in\n",
       "him then--the thing rife in him that was not hate, but something as\n",
       "remorseless--might have been the fiery fruition of a whole lifetime of\n",
       "vengeful quest. Nothing could have stopped him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters thought out the race shrewdly. The rider on Bells would probably\n",
       "drop behind and take to the sage. What he did was of little moment\n",
       "to Venters. To stop Jerry Card, his evil hidden career as well as\n",
       "his present flight, and then to catch the blacks--that was all that\n",
       "concerned Venters. The cattle trail wound for miles and miles down the\n",
       "slope. Venters saw with a rider's keen vision ten, fifteen, twenty miles\n",
       "of clear purple sage. There were no on-coming riders or rustlers to aid\n",
       "Card. His only chance to escape lay in abandoning the stolen horses and\n",
       "creeping away in the sage to hide. In ten miles Wrangle could run\n",
       "Black Star and Night off their feet, and in fifteen he could kill them\n",
       "outright. So Venters held the sorrel in, letting Card make the running.\n",
       "It was a long race that would save the blacks.\n",
       "\n",
       "In a few miles of that swinging canter Wrangle had crept appreciably\n",
       "closer to the three horses. Jerry Card turned again, and when he saw how\n",
       "the sorrel had gained, he put Black Star to a gallop. Night and Bells,\n",
       "on either side of him, swept into his stride.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters loosened the rein on Wrangle and let him break into a gallop.\n",
       "The sorrel saw the horses ahead and wanted to run. But Venters\n",
       "restrained him. And in the gallop he gained more than in the canter.\n",
       "Bells was fast in that gait, but Black Star and Night had been trained\n",
       "to run. Slowly Wrangle closed the gap down to a quarter of a mile, and\n",
       "crept closer and closer.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jerry Card wheeled once more. Venters distinctly saw the red flash of\n",
       "his red face. This time he looked long. Venters laughed. He knew what\n",
       "passed in Card's mind. The rider was trying to make out what horse it\n",
       "happened to be that thus gained on Jane Withersteen's peerless racers.\n",
       "Wrangle had so long been away from the village that not improbably Jerry\n",
       "had forgotten. Besides, whatever Jerry's qualifications for his fame as\n",
       "the greatest rider of the sage, certain it was that his best point was\n",
       "not far-sightedness. He had not recognized Wrangle. After what must have\n",
       "been a searching gaze he got his comrade to face about. This action gave\n",
       "Venters amusement. It spoke so surely of the facts that neither Card\n",
       "nor the rustler actually knew their danger. Yet if they kept to the\n",
       "trail--and the last thing such men would do would be to leave it--they\n",
       "were both doomed.\n",
       "\n",
       "This comrade of Card's whirled far around in his saddle, and he even\n",
       "shaded his eyes from the sun. He, too, looked long. Then, all at once,\n",
       "he faced ahead again and, bending lower in the saddle, began to fling\n",
       "his right arm up and down. That flinging Venters knew to be the lashing\n",
       "of Bells. Jerry also became active. And the three racers lengthened out\n",
       "into a run.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Now, Wrangle!” cried Venters. “Run, you big devil! Run!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters laid the reins on Wrangle's neck and dropped the loop over\n",
       "the pommel. The sorrel needed no guiding on that smooth trail. He was\n",
       "surer-footed in a run than at any other fast gait, and his running gave\n",
       "the impression of something devilish. He might now have been actuated by\n",
       "Venters's spirit; undoubtedly his savage running fitted the mood of his\n",
       "rider. Venters bent forward swinging with the horse, and gripped his\n",
       "rifle. His eye measured the distance between him and Jerry Card.\n",
       "\n",
       "In less than two miles of running Bells began to drop behind the blacks,\n",
       "and Wrangle began to overhaul him. Venters anticipated that the rustler\n",
       "would soon take to the sage. Yet he did not. Not improbably he reasoned\n",
       "that the powerful sorrel could more easily overtake Bells in the heavier\n",
       "going outside of the trail. Soon only a few hundred yards lay between\n",
       "Bells and Wrangle. Turning in his saddle, the rustler began to shoot,\n",
       "and the bullets beat up little whiffs of dust. Venters raised his rifle,\n",
       "ready to take snap shots, and waited for favorable opportunity when\n",
       "Bells was out of line with the forward horses. Venters had it in him\n",
       "to kill these men as if they were skunk-bitten coyotes, but also he had\n",
       "restraint enough to keep from shooting one of Jane's beloved Arabians.\n",
       "\n",
       "No great distance was covered, however, before Bells swerved to the\n",
       "left, out of line with Black Star and Night. Then Venters, aiming high\n",
       "and waiting for the pause between Wrangle's great strides, began to take\n",
       "snap shots at the rustler. The fleeing rider presented a broad target\n",
       "for a rifle, but he was moving swiftly forward and bobbing up and down.\n",
       "Moreover, shooting from Wrangle's back was shooting from a thunderbolt.\n",
       "And added to that was the danger of a low-placed bullet taking effect\n",
       "on Bells. Yet, despite these considerations, making the shot exceedingly\n",
       "difficult, Venters's confidence, like his implacability, saw a speedy\n",
       "and fatal termination of that rustler's race. On the sixth shot the\n",
       "rustler threw up his arms and took a flying tumble off his horse. He\n",
       "rolled over and over, hunched himself to a half-erect position, fell,\n",
       "and then dragged himself into the sage. As Venters went thundering by he\n",
       "peered keenly into the sage, but caught no sign of the man. Bells ran a\n",
       "few hundred yards, slowed up, and had stopped when Wrangle passed him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Again Venters began slipping fresh cartridges into the magazine of his\n",
       "rifle, and his hand was so sure and steady that he did not drop a single\n",
       "cartridge. With the eye of a rider and the judgment of a marksman he\n",
       "once more measured the distance between him and Jerry Card. Wrangle had\n",
       "gained, bringing him into rifle range. Venters was hard put to it now\n",
       "not to shoot, but thought it better to withhold his fire. Jerry, who, in\n",
       "anticipation of a running fusillade, had huddled himself into a little\n",
       "twisted ball on Black Star's neck, now surmising that this pursuer would\n",
       "make sure of not wounding one of the blacks, rose to his natural seat in\n",
       "the saddle.\n",
       "\n",
       "In his mind perhaps, as certainly as in Venters's, this moment was the\n",
       "beginning of the real race.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters leaned forward to put his hand on Wrangle's neck, then backward\n",
       "to put it on his flank. Under the shaggy, dusty hair trembled and\n",
       "vibrated and rippled a wonderful muscular activity. But Wrangle's flesh\n",
       "was still cold. What a cold-blooded brute thought Venters, and felt in\n",
       "him a love for the horse he had never given to any other. It would not\n",
       "have been humanly possible for any rider, even though clutched by hate\n",
       "or revenge or a passion to save a loved one or fear of his own life, to\n",
       "be astride the sorrel to swing with his swing, to see his magnificent\n",
       "stride and hear the rapid thunder of his hoofs, to ride him in that race\n",
       "and not glory in the ride.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, with his passion to kill still keen and unabated, Venters lived out\n",
       "that ride, and drank a rider's sage-sweet cup of wildness to the dregs.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Wrangle's long mane, lashing in the wind, stung Venters in the\n",
       "cheek, the sting added a beat to his flying pulse. He bent a downward\n",
       "glance to try to see Wrangle's actual stride, and saw only twinkling,\n",
       "darting streaks and the white rush of the trail. He watched the sorrel's\n",
       "savage head, pointed level, his mouth still closed and dry, but his\n",
       "nostrils distended as if he were snorting unseen fire. Wrangle was the\n",
       "horse for a race with death. Upon each side Venters saw the sage merged\n",
       "into a sailing, colorless wall. In front sloped the lay of ground with\n",
       "its purple breadth split by the white trail. The wind, blowing with\n",
       "heavy, steady blast into his face, sickened him with enduring, sweet\n",
       "odor, and filled his ears with a hollow, rushing roar.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then for the hundredth time he measured the width of space separating\n",
       "him from Jerry Card. Wrangle had ceased to gain. The blacks were proving\n",
       "their fleetness. Venters watched Jerry Card, admiring the little rider's\n",
       "horsemanship. He had the incomparable seat of the upland rider, born in\n",
       "the saddle. It struck Venters that Card had changed his position, or\n",
       "the position of the horses. Presently Venters remembered positively that\n",
       "Jerry had been leading Night on the right-hand side of the trail. The\n",
       "racer was now on the side to the left. No--it was Black Star. But,\n",
       "Venters argued in amaze, Jerry had been mounted on Black Star. Another\n",
       "clearer, keener gaze assured Venters that Black Star was really\n",
       "riderless. Night now carried Jerry Card.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He's changed from one to the other!” ejaculated Venters, realizing the\n",
       "astounding feat with unstinted admiration. “Changed at full speed! Jerry\n",
       "Card, that's what you've done unless I'm drunk on the smell of sage. But\n",
       "I've got to see the trick before I believe it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Thenceforth, while Wrangle sped on, Venters glued his eyes to the little\n",
       "rider. Jerry Card rode as only he could ride. Of all the daring\n",
       "horsemen of the uplands, Jerry was the one rider fitted to bring out the\n",
       "greatness of the blacks in that long race. He had them on a dead run,\n",
       "but not yet at the last strained and killing pace. From time to time he\n",
       "glanced backward, as a wise general in retreat calculating his chances\n",
       "and the power and speed of pursuers, and the moment for the last\n",
       "desperate burst. No doubt, Card, with his life at stake, gloried in that\n",
       "race, perhaps more wildly than Venters. For he had been born to the sage\n",
       "and the saddle and the wild. He was more than half horse. Not until the\n",
       "last call--the sudden up-flashing instinct of self-preservation--would\n",
       "he lose his skill and judgment and nerve and the spirit of that race.\n",
       "Venters seemed to read Jerry's mind. That little crime-stained rider was\n",
       "actually thinking of his horses, husbanding their speed, handling them\n",
       "with knowledge of years, glorying in their beautiful, swift, racing\n",
       "stride, and wanting them to win the race when his own life hung\n",
       "suspended in quivering balance. Again Jerry whirled in his saddle and\n",
       "the sun flashed red on his face. Turning, he drew Black Star closer and\n",
       "closer toward Night, till they ran side by side, as one horse. Then Card\n",
       "raised himself in the saddle, slipped out of the stirrups, and, somehow\n",
       "twisting himself, leaped upon Black Star. He did not even lose the swing\n",
       "of the horse. Like a leech he was there in the other saddle, and as the\n",
       "horses separated, his right foot, that had been apparently doubled under\n",
       "him, shot down to catch the stirrup. The grace and dexterity and daring\n",
       "of that rider's act won something more than admiration from Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the distance of a mile Jerry rode Black Star and then changed back\n",
       "to Night. But all Jerry's skill and the running of the blacks could\n",
       "avail little more against the sorrel.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters peered far ahead, studying the lay of the land. Straightaway\n",
       "for five miles the trail stretched, and then it disappeared in hummocky\n",
       "ground. To the right, some few rods, Venters saw a break in the sage,\n",
       "and this was the rim of Deception Pass. Across the dark cleft gleamed\n",
       "the red of the opposite wall. Venters imagined that the trail went down\n",
       "into the Pass somewhere north of those ridges. And he realized that\n",
       "he must and would overtake Jerry Card in this straight course of five\n",
       "miles.\n",
       "\n",
       "Cruelly he struck his spurs into Wrangle's flanks. A light touch of spur\n",
       "was sufficient to make Wrangle plunge. And now, with a ringing, wild\n",
       "snort, he seemed to double up in muscular convulsions and to shoot\n",
       "forward with an impetus that almost unseated Venters. The sage blurred\n",
       "by, the trail flashed by, and the wind robbed him of breath and hearing.\n",
       "Jerry Card turned once more. And the way he shifted to Black Star showed\n",
       "he had to make his last desperate running. Venters aimed to the side of\n",
       "the trail and sent a bullet puffing the dust beyond Jerry. Venters\n",
       "hoped to frighten the rider and get him to take to the sage. But Jerry\n",
       "returned the shot, and his ball struck dangerously close in the dust\n",
       "at Wrangle's flying feet. Venters held his fire then, while the rider\n",
       "emptied his revolver. For a mile, with Black Star leaving Night behind\n",
       "and doing his utmost, Wrangle did not gain; for another mile he gained\n",
       "little, if at all. In the third he caught up with the now galloping\n",
       "Night and began to gain rapidly on the other black.\n",
       "\n",
       "Only a hundred yards now stretched between Black Star and Wrangle. The\n",
       "giant sorrel thundered on--and on--and on. In every yard he gained\n",
       "a foot. He was whistling through his nostrils, wringing wet, flying\n",
       "lather, and as hot as fire. Savage as ever, strong as ever, fast as\n",
       "ever, but each tremendous stride jarred Venters out of the saddle!\n",
       "Wrangle's power and spirit and momentum had begun to run him off his\n",
       "legs. Wrangle's great race was nearly won--and run. Venters seemed to\n",
       "see the expanse before him as a vast, sheeted, purple plain sliding\n",
       "under him. Black Star moved in it as a blur. The rider, Jerry Card,\n",
       "appeared a mere dot bobbing dimly. Wrangle thundered on--on--on! Venters\n",
       "felt the increase in quivering, straining shock after every leap. Flecks\n",
       "of foam flew into Venters's eyes, burning him, making him see all the\n",
       "sage as red. But in that red haze he saw, or seemed to see, Black Star\n",
       "suddenly riderless and with broken gait. Wrangle thundered on to change\n",
       "his pace with a violent break. Then Venters pulled him hard. From run\n",
       "to gallop, gallop to canter, canter to trot, trot to walk, and walk to\n",
       "stop, the great sorrel ended his race.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters looked back. Black Star stood riderless in the trail. Jerry\n",
       "Card had taken to the sage. Far up the white trail Night came trotting\n",
       "faithfully down. Venters leaped off, still half blind, reeling dizzily.\n",
       "In a moment he had recovered sufficiently to have a care for Wrangle.\n",
       "Rapidly he took off the saddle and bridle. The sorrel was reeking,\n",
       "heaving, whistling, shaking. But he had still the strength to stand, and\n",
       "for him Venters had no fears.\n",
       "\n",
       "As Venters ran back to Black Star he saw the horse stagger on shaking\n",

       "removed the saddle and bridle. Black Star had been killed on his legs,\n",
       "Venters thought. He had no hope for the stricken horse. Black Star\n",
       "lay flat, covered with bloody froth, mouth wide, tongue hanging, eyes\n",
       "glaring, and all his beautiful body in convulsions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Unable to stay there to see Jane's favorite racer die, Venters hurried\n",
       "up the trail to meet the other black. On the way he kept a sharp lookout\n",
       "for Jerry Card. Venters imagined the rider would keep well out of range\n",
       "of the rifle, but, as he would be lost on the sage without a horse, not\n",
       "improbably he would linger in the vicinity on the chance of getting back\n",
       "one of the blacks. Night soon came trotting up, hot and wet and run out.\n",
       "Venters led him down near the others, and unsaddling him, let him loose\n",
       "to rest. Night wearily lay down in the dust and rolled, proving himself\n",
       "not yet spent.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Venters sat down to rest and think. Whatever the risk, he was\n",
       "compelled to stay where he was, or comparatively near, for the night.\n",
       "The horses must rest and drink. He must find water. He was now seventy\n",
       "miles from Cottonwoods, and, he believed, close to the canyon where the\n",
       "cattle trail must surely turn off and go down into the Pass. After a\n",
       "while he rose to survey the valley.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was very near to the ragged edge of a deep canyon into which the\n",
       "trail turned. The ground lay in uneven ridges divided by washes, and\n",
       "these sloped into the canyon. Following the canyon line, he saw where\n",
       "its rim was broken by other intersecting canyons, and farther down red\n",
       "walls and yellow cliffs leading toward a deep blue cleft that he made\n",
       "sure was Deception Pass. Walking out a few rods to a promontory, he\n",
       "found where the trail went down. The descent was gradual, along a\n",
       "stone-walled trail, and Venters felt sure that this was the place where\n",
       "Oldring drove cattle into the Pass. There was, however, no indication at\n",
       "all that he ever had driven cattle out at this point. Oldring had many\n",
       "holes to his burrow.\n",
       "\n",
       "In searching round in the little hollows Venters, much to his relief,\n",
       "found water. He composed himself to rest and eat some bread and meat,\n",
       "while he waited for a sufficient time to elapse so that he could safely\n",
       "give the horses a drink. He judged the hour to be somewhere around noon.\n",
       "Wrangle lay down to rest and Night followed suit. So long as they\n",
       "were down Venters intended to make no move. The longer they rested\n",
       "the better, and the safer it would be to give them water. By and by he\n",
       "forced himself to go over to where Black Star lay, expecting to find\n",
       "him dead. Instead he found the racer partially if not wholly recovered.\n",
       "There was recognition, even fire, in his big black eyes. Venters was\n",
       "overjoyed. He sat by the black for a long time. Black Star presently\n",
       "labored to his feet with a heave and a groan, shook himself, and snorted\n",
       "for water. Venters repaired to the little pool he had found, filled\n",
       "his sombrero, and gave the racer a drink. Black Star gulped it at one\n",
       "draught, as if it were but a drop, and pushed his nose into the hat\n",
       "and snorted for more. Venters now led Night down to drink, and after a\n",
       "further time Black Star also. Then the blacks began to graze.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sorrel had wandered off down the sage between the trail and the\n",
       "canyon. Once or twice he disappeared in little swales. Finally Venters\n",
       "concluded Wrangle had grazed far enough, and, taking his lasso, he went\n",
       "to fetch him back. In crossing from one ridge to another he saw where\n",
       "the horse had made muddy a pool of water. It occurred to Venters then\n",
       "that Wrangle had drunk his fill, and did not seem the worse for it, and\n",
       "might be anything but easy to catch. And, true enough, he could not come\n",
       "within roping reach of the sorrel. He tried for an hour, and gave up in\n",
       "disgust. Wrangle did not seem so wild as simply perverse. In a quandary\n",
       "Venters returned to the other horses, hoping much, yet doubting more,\n",
       "that when Wrangle had grazed to suit himself he might be caught.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the afternoon wore away Venters's concern diminished, yet he kept\n",
       "close watch on the blacks and the trail and the sage. There was no\n",
       "telling of what Jerry Card might be capable. Venters sullenly acquiesced\n",
       "to the idea that the rider had been too quick and too shrewd for him.\n",
       "Strangely and doggedly, however, Venters clung to his foreboding of\n",

       "\n",
       "The wind died away; the red sun topped the far distant western rise of\n",
       "slope; and the long, creeping purple shadows lengthened. The rims of the\n",
       "canyons gleamed crimson and the deep clefts appeared to belch forth blue\n",
       "smoke. Silence enfolded the scene.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was broken by a horrid, long-drawn scream of a horse and the thudding\n",
       "of heavy hoofs. Venters sprang erect and wheeled south. Along the canyon\n",
       "rim, near the edge, came Wrangle, once more in thundering flight.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters gasped in amazement. Had the wild sorrel gone mad? His head\n",
       "was high and twisted, in a most singular position for a running horse.\n",
       "Suddenly Venters descried a frog-like shape clinging to Wrangle's neck.\n",
       "Jerry Card! Somehow he had straddled Wrangle and now stuck like a huge\n",
       "burr. But it was his strange position and the sorrel's wild scream that\n",
       "shook Venters's nerves. Wrangle was pounding toward the turn where the\n",
       "trail went down. He plunged onward like a blind horse. More than one of\n",
       "his leaps took him to the very edge of the precipice.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jerry Card was bent forward with his teeth fast in the front of\n",
       "Wrangle's nose! Venters saw it, and there flashed over him a memory of\n",
       "this trick of a few desperate riders. He even thought of one rider\n",
       "who had worn off his teeth in this terrible hold to break or control\n",
       "desperate horses. Wrangle had indeed gone mad. The marvel was what\n",
       "guided him. Was it the half-brute, the more than half-horse instinct of\n",
       "Jerry Card? Whatever the mystery, it was true. And in a few more rods\n",
       "Jerry would have the sorrel turning into the trail leading down into the\n",
       "canyon.\n",
       "\n",
       "“No--Jerry!” whispered Venters, stepping forward and throwing up the\n",
       "rifle. He tried to catch the little humped, frog-like shape over the\n",
       "sights. It was moving too fast; it was too small. Yet Venters shot\n",
       "once... twice... the third time... four times... five! all wasted shots and\n",
       "precious seconds!\n",
       "\n",
       "With a deep-muttered curse Venters caught Wrangle through the sights and\n",
       "pulled the trigger. Plainly he heard the bullet thud. Wrangle uttered\n",
       "a horrible strangling sound. In swift death action he whirled, and\n",
       "with one last splendid leap he cleared the canyon rim. And he whirled\n",
       "downward with the little frog-like shape clinging to his neck!\n",
       "\n",
       "There was a pause which seemed never ending, a shock, and an instant's\n",
       "silence.\n",

       "Some forty hours or more later Venters created a commotion in\n",
       "Cottonwoods by riding down the main street on Black Star and leading\n",
       "Bells and Night. He had come upon Bells grazing near the body of a dead\n",
       "rustler, the only incident of his quick ride into the village.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nothing was farther from Venters's mind than bravado. No thought came\n",
       "to him of the defiance and boldness of riding Jane Withersteen's racers\n",
       "straight into the arch-plotter's stronghold. He wanted men to see the\n",
       "famous Arabians; he wanted men to see them dirty and dusty, bearing all\n",
       "the signs of having been driven to their limit; he wanted men to see and\n",
       "to know that the thieves who had ridden them out into the sage had not\n",
       "ridden them back. Venters had come for that and for more--he wanted to\n",
       "meet Tull face to face; if not Tull, then Dyer; if not Dyer, then anyone\n",
       "in the secret of these master conspirators. Such was Venters's passion.\n",
       "The meeting with the rustlers, the unprovoked attack upon him, the\n",
       "spilling of blood, the recognition of Jerry Card and the horses, the\n",
       "race, and that last plunge of mad Wrangle--all these things, fuel on\n",
       "fuel to the smoldering fire, had kindled and swelled and leaped into\n",
       "living flame. He could have shot Dyer in the midst of his religious\n",
       "services at the altar; he could have killed Tull in front of wives and\n",
       "babes.\n",
       "\n",
       "He walked the three racers down the broad, green-bordered village road.\n",
       "He heard the murmur of running water from Amber Spring. Bitter waters\n",
       "for Jane Withersteen! Men and women stopped to gaze at him and the\n",
       "horses. All knew him; all knew the blacks and the bay. As well as if it\n",
       "had been spoken, Venters read in the faces of men the intelligence that\n",
       "Jane Withersteen's Arabians had been known to have been stolen. Venters\n",
       "reined in and halted before Dyer's residence. It was a low, long, stone\n",
       "structure resembling Withersteen House. The spacious front yard was\n",
       "green and luxuriant with grass and flowers; gravel walks led to the huge\n",
       "porch; a well-trimmed hedge of purple sage separated the yard from the\n",
       "church grounds; birds sang in the trees; water flowed musically along\n",
       "the walks; and there were glad, careless shouts of children. For Venters\n",
       "the beauty of this home, and the serenity and its apparent happiness,\n",
       "all turned red and black. For Venters a shade overspread the lawn, the\n",
       "flowers, the old vine-clad stone house. In the music of the singing\n",
       "birds, in the murmur of the running water, he heard an ominous sound.\n",
       "Quiet beauty--sweet music--innocent laughter! By what monstrous abortion\n",
       "of fate did these abide in the shadow of Dyer?\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters rode on and stopped before Tull's cottage. Women stared at him\n",
       "with white faces and then flew from the porch. Tull himself appeared\n",
       "at the door, bent low, craning his neck. His dark face flashed out of\n",
       "sight; the door banged; a heavy bar dropped with a hollow sound.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Venters shook Black Star's bridle, and, sharply trotting, led the\n",
       "other horses to the center of the village. Here at the intersecting\n",
       "streets and in front of the stores he halted once more. The usual\n",
       "lounging atmosphere of that prominent corner was not now in evidence.\n",
       "Riders and ranchers and villagers broke up what must have been absorbing\n",
       "conversation. There was a rush of many feet, and then the walk was lined\n",
       "with faces.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters's glance swept down the line of silent stone-faced men. He\n",
       "recognized many riders and villagers, but none of those he had hoped\n",
       "to meet. There was no expression in the faces turned toward him. All\n",
       "of them knew him, most were inimical, but there were few who were\n",
       "not burning with curiosity and wonder in regard to the return of Jane\n",
       "Withersteen's racers. Yet all were silent. Here were the familiar\n",
       "characteristics--masked feeling--strange secretiveness--expressionless\n",
       "expression of mystery and hidden power.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Has anybody here seen Jerry Card?” queried Venters, in a loud voice.\n",
       "\n",
       "In reply there came not a word, not a nod or shake of head, not so much\n",
       "as dropping eye or twitching lip--nothing but a quiet, stony stare.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Been under the knife? You've a fine knife-wielder here--one Tull, I\n",
       "believe!... Maybe you've all had your tongues cut out?”\n",
       "\n",
       "This passionate sarcasm of Venters brought no response, and the stony\n",
       "calm was as oil on the fire within him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I see some of you pack guns, too!” he added, in biting scorn. In the\n",
       "long, tense pause, strung keenly as a tight wire, he sat motionless on\n",
       "Black Star. “All right,” he went on. “Then let some of you take this\n",

       "\n",
       "Thereupon, in the same dead calm, Venters backed Black Star away from\n",

       "\n",
       "“Hello, Venters!” a familiar voice cried, hoarsely, and he saw a man\n",

       "Venters's hand. “Venters, I could hev dropped when I seen them hosses.\n",
       "But thet sight ain't a marker to the looks of you. What's wrong? Hev\n",

       "“Hasn't Lassiter made a break yet?” inquired Venters, curiously.\n",

       "“Judkins, you're a good fellow,” interrupted Venters. “Some day I'll\n",

       "\n",
       "Judkins stared, and then, muttering to himself, he mounted Bells, and\n",

       "\n",
       "Once, long before, on the night Venters had carried Bess through the\n",

       "of faculties singularly, tinglingly acute. And now the same sensation\n",
       "recurred. But it was different in that he felt cold, frozen, mechanical\n",
       "incapable of free thought, and all about him seemed unreal, aloof,\n",
       "remote. He hid his rifle in the sage, marking its exact location with\n",
       "extreme care. Then he faced down the lane and strode toward the center\n",
       "of the village. Perceptions flashed upon him, the faint, cold touch of\n",
       "the breeze, a cold, silvery tinkle of flowing water, a cold sun shining\n",
       "out of a cold sky, song of birds and laugh of children, coldly distant.\n",

       "tighter stretched the skin over his face; colder and harder grew the\n",
       "polished butts of his guns; colder and steadier became his hands as he\n",
       "wiped the clammy sweat from his face or reached low to his gun-sheaths.\n",
       "Men meeting him in the walk gave him wide berth. In front of Bevin's\n",

       "were faces and whispers of a dream. He turned a corner to meet Tull\n",
       "face to face, eye to eye. As once before he had seen this man pale to\n",
       "a ghastly, livid white so again he saw the change. Tull stopped in his\n",
       "tracks, with right hand raised and shaking. Suddenly it dropped, and he\n",
       "seemed to glide aside, to pass out of Venters's sight. Next he saw\n",
       "many horses with bridles down--all clean-limbed, dark bays or\n",
       "blacks--rustlers' horses! Loud voices and boisterous laughter, rattle of\n",
       "dice and scrape of chair and clink of gold, burst in mingled din from an\n",
       "open doorway. He stepped inside.\n",
       "\n",
       "With the sight of smoke-hazed room and drinking, cursing, gambling,\n",
       "dark-visaged men, reality once more dawned upon Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "His entrance had been unnoticed, and he bent his gaze upon the drinkers\n",
       "at the bar. Dark-clothed, dark-faced men they all were, burned by the\n",
       "sun, bow-legged as were most riders of the sage, but neither lean nor\n",
       "gaunt. Then Venters's gaze passed to the tables, and swiftly it swept\n",
       "over the hard-featured gamesters, to alight upon the huge, shaggy, black\n",
       "head of the rustler chief.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oldring!” he cried, and to him his voice seemed to split a bell in his\n",

       "\n",
       "It stilled the din.\n",
       "\n",
       "That silence suddenly broke to the scrape and crash of Oldring's chair\n",
       "as he rose; and then, while he passed, a great gloomy figure, again the\n",

       "\n",
       "Oldring kicked a chair out of his way and lunged forward with a stamp\n",

       "\n",
       "Venters backed out of the door and waited, hearing, as no sound had ever\n",
       "before struck into his soul, the rapid, heavy steps of the rustler.\n",
       "\n",
       "Oldring appeared, and Venters had one glimpse of his great breadth and\n",
       "bulk, his gold-buckled belt with hanging guns, his high-top boots\n",
       "with gold spurs. In that moment Venters had a strange, unintelligible\n",
       "curiosity to see Oldring alive. The rustler's broad brow, his large\n",
       "black eyes, his sweeping beard, as dark as the wing of a raven, his\n",
       "enormous width of shoulder and depth of chest, his whole splendid\n",
       "presence so wonderfully charged with vitality and force and strength,\n",
       "seemed to afford Venters an unutterable fiendish joy because for that\n",
       "magnificent manhood and life he meant cold and sudden death.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oldring, Bess is alive! But she's dead to you--dead to the life you\n",
       "made her lead--dead as you will be in one second!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Swift as lightning Venters's glance dropped from Oldring's rolling\n",
       "eyes to his hands. One of them, the right, swept out, then toward his\n",
       "gun--and Venters shot him through the heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "Slowly Oldring sank to his knees, and the hand, dragging at the gun,\n",
       "fell away. Venters's strangely acute faculties grasped the meaning\n",
       "of that limp arm, of the swaying hulk, of the gasp and heave, of the\n",
       "quivering beard. But was that awful spirit in the black eyes only one of\n",
       "vitality?\n",
       "\n",
       "“Man--why--didn't--you--wait? Bess--was--” Oldring's whisper died under\n",
       "his beard, and with a heavy lurch he fell forward.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bounding swiftly away, Venters fled around the corner, across the\n",
       "street, and, leaping a hedge, he ran through yard, orchard, and garden\n",
       "to the sage. Here, under cover of the tall brush, he turned west and ran\n",
       "on to the place where he had hidden his rifle. Securing that, he again\n",
       "set out into a run, and, circling through the sage, came up behind Jane\n",
       "Withersteen's stable and corrals. With laboring, dripping chest, and\n",
       "pain as of a knife thrust in his side, he stopped to regain his breath,\n",
       "and while resting his eyes roved around in search of a horse. Doors\n",
       "and windows of the stable were open wide and had a deserted look. One\n",
       "dejected, lonely burro stood in the near corral. Strange indeed was the\n",
       "silence brooding over the once happy, noisy home of Jane Withersteen's\n",
       "pets.\n",
       "\n",
       "He went into the corral, exercising care to leave no tracks, and led the\n",
       "burro to the watering-trough. Venters, though not thirsty, drank till he\n",
       "could drink no more. Then, leading the burro over hard ground, he struck\n",
       "into the sage and down the slope.\n",
       "\n",
       "He strode swiftly, turning from time to time to scan the slope for\n",
       "riders. His head just topped the level of sage-brush, and the burro\n",
       "could not have been seen at all. Slowly the green of Cottonwoods sank\n",
       "behind the slope, and at last a wavering line of purple sage met the\n",
       "blue of sky.\n",
       "\n",
       "To avoid being seen, to get away, to hide his trail--these were the sole\n",
       "ideas in his mind as he headed for Deception Pass, and he directed all\n",
       "his acuteness of eye and ear, and the keenness of a rider's judgment for\n",
       "distance and ground, to stern accomplishment of the task. He kept to the\n",
       "sage far to the left of the trail leading into the Pass. He walked ten\n",
       "miles and looked back a thousand times. Always the graceful, purple wave\n",
       "of sage remained wide and lonely, a clear, undotted waste. Coming to a\n",
       "stretch of rocky ground, he took advantage of it to cross the trail and\n",
       "then continued down on the right. At length he persuaded himself that he\n",
       "would be able to see riders mounted on horses before they could see him\n",
       "on the little burro, and he rode bareback.\n",
       "\n",
       "Hour by hour the tireless burro kept to his faithful, steady trot. The\n",
       "sun sank and the long shadows lengthened down the slope. Moving veils of\n",
       "purple twilight crept out of the hollows and, mustering and forming on\n",
       "the levels, soon merged and shaded into night. Venters guided the\n",
       "burro nearer to the trail, so that he could see its white line from the\n",
       "ridges, and rode on through the hours.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once down in the Pass without leaving a trail, he would hold himself\n",
       "safe for the time being. When late in the night he reached the break in\n",
       "the sage, he sent the burro down ahead of him, and started an avalanche\n",
       "that all but buried the animal at the bottom of the trail. Bruised and\n",
       "battered as he was, he had a moment's elation, for he had hidden his\n",
       "tracks. Once more he mounted the burro and rode on. The hour was the\n",
       "blackest of the night when he made the thicket which inclosed his old\n",
       "camp. Here he turned the burro loose in the grass near the spring, and\n",
       "then lay down on his old bed of leaves.\n",
       "\n",
       "He felt only vaguely, as outside things, the ache and burn and throb\n",
       "of the muscles of his body. But a dammed-up torrent of emotion at last\n",
       "burst its bounds, and the hour that saw his release from immediate\n",
       "action was one that confounded him in the reaction of his spirit. He\n",
       "suffered without understanding why. He caught glimpses into himself,\n",
       "into unlit darkness of soul. The fire that had blistered him and the\n",
       "cold which had frozen him now united in one torturing possession of his\n",
       "mind and heart, and like a fiery steed with ice-shod feet, ranged his\n",
       "being, ran rioting through his blood, trampling the resurging good,\n",
       "dragging ever at the evil.\n",
       "\n",
       "Out of the subsiding chaos came a clear question. What had happened?\n",
       "He had left the valley to go to Cottonwoods. Why? It seemed that he had\n",
       "gone to kill a man--Oldring! The name riveted his consciousness upon the\n",
       "one man of all men upon earth whom he had wanted to meet. He had met the\n",
       "rustler. Venters recalled the smoky haze of the saloon, the dark-visaged\n",
       "men, the huge Oldring. He saw him step out of the door, a splendid\n",
       "specimen of manhood, a handsome giant with purple-black and sweeping\n",
       "beard. He remembered inquisitive gaze of falcon eyes. He heard himself\n",
       "repeating: “OLDRING, BESS IS ALIVE! BUT SHE'S DEAD TO YOU,” and he felt\n",
       "himself jerk, and his ears throbbed to the thunder of a gun, and he\n",
       "saw the giant sink slowly to his knees. Was that only the vitality\n",
       "of him--that awful light in the eyes--only the hard-dying life of\n",
       "a tremendously powerful brute? A broken whisper, strange as death:\n",
       "“MAN--WHY--DIDN'T--YOU WAIT! BESS--WAS--” And Oldring plunged face\n",
       "forward, dead.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I killed him,” cried Venters, in remembering shock. “But it wasn't\n",
       "THAT. Ah, the look in his eyes and his whisper!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Herein lay the secret that had clamored to him through all the tumult\n",
       "and stress of his emotions. What a look in the eyes of a man shot\n",
       "through the heart! It had been neither hate nor ferocity nor fear of\n",
       "men nor fear of death. It had been no passionate glinting spirit of a\n",
       "fearless foe, willing shot for shot, life for life, but lacking physical\n",
       "power. Distinctly recalled now, never to be forgotten, Venters saw\n",
       "in Oldring's magnificent eyes the rolling of great, glad\n",
       "surprise--softness--love! Then came a shadow and the terrible superhuman\n",
       "striving of his spirit to speak. Oldring shot through the heart, had\n",
       "fought and forced back death, not for a moment in which to shoot or\n",
       "curse, but to whisper strange words.\n",
       "\n",
       "What words for a dying man to whisper! Why had not Venters waited? For\n",
       "what? That was no plea for life. It was regret that there was not a\n",
       "moment of life left in which to speak. Bess was--Herein lay renewed\n",
       "torture for Venters. What had Bess been to Oldring? The old question,\n",
       "like a specter, stalked from its grave to haunt him. He had overlooked,\n",
       "he had forgiven, he had loved and he had forgotten; and now, out of the\n",
       "mystery of a dying man's whisper rose again that perverse, unsatisfied,\n",
       "jealous uncertainty. Bess had loved that splendid, black-crowned\n",
       "giant--by her own confession she had loved him; and in Venters's soul\n",
       "again flamed up the jealous hell. Then into the clamoring hell burst the\n",
       "shot that had killed Oldring, and it rang in a wild fiendish gladness,\n",
       "a hateful, vengeful joy. That passed to the memory of the love and\n",
       "light in Oldring's eyes and the mystery in his whisper. So the changing,\n",
       "swaying emotions fluctuated in Venters's heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "This was the climax of his year of suffering and the crucial struggle\n",
       "of his life. And when the gray dawn came he rose, a gloomy, almost\n",
       "heartbroken man, but victor over evil passions. He could not change the\n",
       "past; and, even if he had not loved Bess with all his soul, he had grown\n",
       "into a man who would not change the future he had planned for her. Only,\n",
       "and once for all, he must know the truth, know the worst, stifle all\n",
       "these insistent doubts and subtle hopes and jealous fancies, and kill\n",
       "the past by knowing truly what Bess had been to Oldring. For that matter\n",
       "he knew--he had always known, but he must hear it spoken. Then, when\n",
       "they had safely gotten out of that wild country to take up a new and an\n",
       "absorbing life, she would forget, she would be happy, and through that,\n",
       "in the years to come, he could not but find life worth living.\n",
       "\n",
       "All day he rode slowly and cautiously up the Pass, taking time to peer\n",
       "around corners, to pick out hard ground and grassy patches, and to make\n",
       "sure there was no one in pursuit. In the night sometime he came to the\n",
       "smooth, scrawled rocks dividing the valley, and here set the burro at\n",
       "liberty. He walked beyond, climbed the slope and the dim, starlit gorge.\n",
       "Then, weary to the point of exhaustion, he crept into a shallow cave and\n",
       "fell asleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the morning, when he descended the trail, he found the sun was\n",
       "pouring a golden stream of light through the arch of the great stone\n",
       "bridge. Surprise Valley, like a valley of dreams, lay mystically soft\n",
       "and beautiful, awakening to the golden flood which was rolling away its\n",
       "slumberous bands of mist, brightening its walled faces.\n",
       "\n",
       "While yet far off he discerned Bess moving under the silver spruces, and\n",
       "soon the barking of the dogs told him that they had seen him. He heard\n",
       "the mocking-birds singing in the trees, and then the twittering of the\n",
       "quail. Ring and Whitie came bounding toward him, and behind them ran\n",
       "Bess, her hands outstretched.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern! You're back! You're back!” she cried, in joy that rang of her\n",
       "loneliness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes, I'm back,” he said, as she rushed to meet him.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had reached out for him when suddenly, as she saw him closely,\n",
       "something checked her, and as quickly all her joy fled, and with it her\n",
       "color, leaving her pale and trembling.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh! What's happened?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“A good deal has happened, Bess. I don't need to tell you what. And I'm\n",
       "played out. Worn out in mind more than body.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Dear--you look strange to me!” faltered Bess.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Never mind that. I'm all right. There's nothing for you to be scared\n",
       "about. Things are going to turn out just as we have planned. As soon as\n",
       "I'm rested we'll make a break to get out of the country. Only now, right\n",
       "now, I must know the truth about you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Truth about me?” echoed Bess, shrinkingly. She seemed to be casting\n",
       "back into her mind for a forgotten key. Venters himself, as he saw her,\n",
       "received a pang.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes--the truth. Bess, don't misunderstand. I haven't changed that way.\n",
       "I love you still. I'll love you more afterward. Life will be just as\n",
       "sweet--sweeter to us. We'll be--be married as soon as ever we can. We'll\n",
       "be happy--but there's a devil in me. A perverse, jealous devil! Then\n",
       "I've queer fancies. I forgot for a long time. Now all those fiendish\n",
       "little whispers of doubt and faith and fear and hope come torturing me\n",
       "again. I've got to kill them with the truth.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'll tell you anything you want to know,” she replied, frankly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Then by Heaven! we'll have it over and done with!... Bess--did Oldring\n",
       "love you?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Certainly he did.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Did--did you love him?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Of course. I told you so.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“How can you tell it so lightly?” cried Venters, passionately. “Haven't\n",
       "you any sense of--of--” He choked back speech. He felt the rush of pain\n",
       "and passion. He seized her in rude, strong hands and drew her close. He\n",
       "looked straight into her dark-blue eyes. They were shadowing with the\n",
       "old wistful light, but they were as clear as the limpid water of the\n",
       "spring. They were earnest, solemn in unutterable love and faith and\n",
       "abnegation. Venters shivered. He knew he was looking into her soul.\n",
       "He knew she could not lie in that moment; but that she might tell the\n",
       "truth, looking at him with those eyes, almost killed his belief in\n",
       "purity.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What are--what were you to--to Oldring?” he panted, fiercely.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I am his daughter,” she replied, instantly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters slowly let go of her. There was a violent break in the force of\n",
       "his feeling--then creeping blankness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What--was it--you said?” he asked, in a kind of dull wonder.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I am his daughter.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oldring's daughter?” queried Venters, with life gathering in his voice.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "With a passionately awakening start he grasped her hands and drew her\n",
       "close.\n",
       "\n",
       "“All the time--you've been Oldring's daughter?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes, of course all the time--always.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“But Bess, you told me--you let me think--I made out you were--a--so--so\n",
       "ashamed.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“It is my shame,” she said, with voice deep and full, and now the\n",
       "scarlet fired her cheek. “I told you--I'm nothing--nameless--just Bess,\n",
       "Oldring's girl!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I know--I remember. But I never thought--” he went on, hurriedly,\n",
       "huskily. “That time--when you lay dying--you prayed--you--somehow I got\n",
       "the idea you were bad.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bad?” she asked, with a little laugh.\n",
       "\n",
       "She looked up with a faint smile of bewilderment and the absolute\n",
       "unconsciousness of a child. Venters gasped in the gathering might of the\n",
       "truth. She did not understand his meaning.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess! Bess!” He clasped her in his arms, hiding her eyes against his\n",
       "breast. She must not see his face in that moment. And he held her while\n",
       "he looked out across the valley. In his dim and blinded sight, in\n",
       "the blur of golden light and moving mist, he saw Oldring. She was the\n",
       "rustler's nameless daughter. Oldring had loved her. He had so guarded\n",
       "her, so kept her from women and men and knowledge of life that her mind\n",
       "was as a child's. That was part of the secret--part of the mystery.\n",
       "That was the wonderful truth. Not only was she not bad, but good, pure,\n",
       "innocent above all innocence in the world--the innocence of lonely\n",

       "At the home of Jane Withersteen Little Fay was climbing Lassiter's knee.\n",

       "“Does oo love me?” she asked.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter, who was as serious with Fay as he was gentle and loving,\n",
       "assured her in earnest and elaborate speech that he was her devoted\n",
       "subject. Fay looked thoughtful and appeared to be debating the duplicity\n",
       "of men or searching for a supreme test to prove this cavalier.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Does oo love my new muvver?” she asked, with bewildering suddenness.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane Withersteen laughed, and for the first time in many a day she felt\n",
       "a stir of her pulse and warmth in her cheek.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a still drowsy summer of afternoon, and the three were sitting\n",
       "in the shade of the wooded knoll that faced the sage-slope. Little Fay's\n",
       "brief spell of unhappy longing for her mother--the childish, mystic\n",
       "gloom--had passed, and now where Fay was there were prattle and laughter\n",
       "and glee. She had emerged from sorrow to be the incarnation of joy and\n",
       "loveliness. She had grown supernaturally sweet and beautiful. For Jane\n",
       "Withersteen the child was an answer to prayer, a blessing, a possession\n",
       "infinitely more precious than all she had lost. For Lassiter, Jane\n",
       "divined that little Fay had become a religion.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“Because,” replied Jane. And she found it strangely embarrassing to meet\n",

       "grow up gradually takin' on that falseness, an' be like the rest of the\n",
       "women, an' men, too. An' the truth of this falseness to life is proved\n",

       "I've loved the truth, and I've prided myself upon being truthful. Maybe\n",
       "that was only egotism. I'm learning much, my friend. Some of those\n",
       "blinding scales have fallen from my eyes. And--and as to caring for you,\n",
       "I think I care a great deal. How much, how little, I couldn't say. My\n",

       "affection. I can still play and be merry with Fay. I can still dream.\n",
       "But when I attempt serious thought I'm dazed. I don't think. I don't\n",

       "my numb feeling I believe I'll rise out of all this dark agony a better\n",

       "been poor, an' there we prospered. In time the little village where we\n",
       "went became a town, an' strangers an' new families kept movin' in. Milly\n",
       "was the belle them days. I can see her now, a little girl no bigger 'n\n",
       "a bird, an' as pretty. She had the finest eyes, dark blue-black when she\n",

       "when she met Frank Erne she went in heart an' soul for the salvation of\n",
       "souls. Fact was, Milly, through study of the Bible an' attendin' church\n",
       "an' revivals, went a little out of her head. It didn't worry the old\n",
       "folks none, an' the only worry to me was Milly's everlastin' prayin' an'\n",
       "workin' to save my soul. She never converted me, but we was the best\n",
       "of comrades, an' I reckon no brother an' sister ever loved each other\n",
       "better. Well, Frank Erne an me hit up a great friendship. He was a\n",
       "strappin' feller, good to look at, an' had the most pleasin' ways. His\n",

       "little town. An' he an' Frank become rivals. This feller was different\n",
       "from Frank. He preached some other kind of religion, and he was quick\n",
       "an' passionate, where Frank was slow an' mild. He went after people,\n",
       "women specially. In looks he couldn't compare to Frank Erne, but he had\n",
       "power over women. He had a voice, an' he talked an' talked an' preached\n",
       "an' preached. Milly fell under his influence. She became mightily\n",
       "interested in his religion. Frank had patience with her, as was his way,\n",
       "an' let her be as interested as she liked. All religions were devoted to\n",
       "one God, he said, an' it wouldn't hurt Milly none to study a different\n",
       "point of view. So the new preacher often called on Milly, an' sometimes\n",
       "in Frank's absence. Frank was a cattle-man between Sundays.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Along about this time an incident come off that I couldn't get much\n",
       "light on. A stranger come to town, an' was seen with the preacher. This\n",
       "stranger was a big man with an eye like blue ice, an' a beard of gold.\n",
       "He had money, an' he 'peered a man of mystery, an' the town went to\n",
       "buzzin' when he disappeared about the same time as a young woman\n",
       "known to be mightily interested in the new preacher's religion. Then,\n",
       "presently, along comes a man from somewheres in Illinois, en' he up an'\n",
       "spots this preacher as a famous Mormon proselyter. That riled Frank Erne\n",
       "as nothin' ever before, an' from rivals they come to be bitter enemies.\n",
       "An' it ended in Frank goin' to the meetin'-house where Milly\n",
       "was listenin', en' before her en' everybody else he called that\n",
       "preacher--called him, well, almost as hard as Venters called Tull here\n",
       "sometime back. An' Frank followed up that call with a hosswhippin', en'\n",

       "\n",
       "“People noticed, so 'twas said, that Milly's sweet disposition changed.\n",
       "Some said it was because she would soon become a mother, en' others\n",
       "said she was pinin' after the new religion. An' there was women who\n",
       "said right out that she was pinin' after the Mormon. Anyway, one mornin'\n",
       "Frank rode in from one of his trips, to find Milly gone. He had no real\n",
       "near neighbors--livin' a little out of town--but those who was nearest\n",
       "said a wagon had gone by in the night, an' they thought it stopped at her\n",
       "door. Well, tracks always tell, an' there was the wagon tracks an' hoss\n",
       "tracks an' man tracks. The news spread like wildfire that Milly had run\n",
       "off from her husband. Everybody but Frank believed it an' wasn't slow in\n",
       "tellin' why she run off. Mother had always hated that strange streak of\n",
       "Milly's, takin' up with the new religion as she had, an' she believed\n",
       "Milly ran off with the Mormon. That hastened mother's death, an' she\n",

       "have done that. I stayed at home awhile, tryin' to make Frank Erne talk.\n",
       "But if he knowed anythin' then he wouldn't tell it. So I set out to find\n",
       "Milly. An' I tried to get on the trail of that proselyter. I knew if I\n",
       "ever struck a town he'd visited that I'd get a trail. I knew, too, that\n",
       "nothin' short of hell would stop his proselytin'. An' I rode from town\n",

       "weeks an' months went by I growed into a strange sort of a man, I guess.\n",
       "Anyway, people were afraid of me. Two years after that, way over in a\n",
       "corner of Texas, I struck a town where my man had been. He'd jest left.\n",
       "People said he came to that town without a woman. I back-trailed my man\n",

       "Texas. I found the town where he first went after leavin' home. An' here\n",
       "I got track of Milly. I found a cabin where she had given birth to her\n",
       "baby. There was no way to tell whether she'd been kept a prisoner or\n",
       "not. The feller who owned the place was a mean, silent sort of a skunk,\n",
       "an' as I was leavin' I jest took a chance an' left my mark on him. Then\n",

       "his cattle had strayed or been rustled, his house weathered till it\n",
       "wouldn't keep out rain nor wind. An' Frank set on the porch and whittled\n",
       "sticks, an' day by day wasted away. There was times when he ranted about\n",
       "like a crazy man, but mostly he was always sittin' an' starin' with eyes\n",
       "that made a man curse. I figured Frank had a secret fear that I needed\n",
       "to know. An' when I told him I'd trailed Milly for near three years an'\n",

       "certain elements of the eternal feminine.\n",
       "\n",
       "“But there was a woman and you did lie to me,” she kept repeating, after\n",

       "\n",
       "“What of that? Bess, I'll get angry at you in a moment. Remember you've\n",
       "been pent up all your life. I venture to say that if you'd been out in\n",
       "the world you'd have had a dozen sweethearts and have told many a lie\n",
       "before this.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I wouldn't anything of the kind,” declared Bess, indignantly.\n",
       "\n",

       "without further interruption.\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters closed up the opening of the cave with a thatch of willows and\n",
       "aspens, so that not even a bird or a rat could get in to the sacks\n",
       "of grain. And this work was in order with the precaution habitually\n",
       "observed by him. He might not be able to get out of Utah, and have to\n",
       "return to the valley. But he owed it to Bess to make the attempt, and in\n",
       "case they were compelled to turn back he wanted to find that fine store\n",
       "of food and grain intact. The outfit of implements and utensils he\n",
       "packed away in another cave.\n",

       "They let the eight calves out of the corral, and kept only two of the\n",

       "\n",
       "The last sunset and twilight and night were both the sweetest and\n",
       "saddest they had ever spent in Surprise Valley. Morning brought keen\n",
       "exhilaration and excitement. When Venters had saddled the two burros,\n",
       "strapped on the light packs and the two canteens, the sunlight was\n",
       "dispersing the lazy shadows from the valley. Taking a last look at the\n",
       "caves and the silver spruces, Venters and Bess made a reluctant start,\n",
       "leading the burros. Ring and Whitie looked keen and knowing. Something\n",
       "seemed to drag at Venters's feet and he noticed Bess lagged behind.\n",
       "Never had the climb from terrace to bridge appeared so long.\n",
       "\n",
       "Not till they reached the opening of the gorge did they stop to rest and\n",
       "take one last look at the valley. The tremendous arch of stone curved\n",
       "clear and sharp in outline against the morning sky. And through it\n",
       "streaked the golden shaft. The valley seemed an enchanted circle of\n",
       "glorious veils of gold and wraiths of white and silver haze and dim,\n",
       "blue, moving shade--beautiful and wild and unreal as a dream.\n",
       "\n",
       "“We--we can--th--think of it--always--re--remember,” sobbed Bess.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hush! Don't cry. Our valley has only fitted us for a better life\n",
       "somewhere. Come!”\n",
       "\n",
       "They entered the gorge and he closed the willow gate. From rosy, golden\n",
       "morning light they passed into cool, dense gloom. The burros pattered\n",
       "up the trail with little hollow-cracking steps. And the gorge widened to\n",
       "narrow outlet and the gloom lightened to gray. At the divide they halted\n",
       "for another rest. Venters's keen, remembering gaze searched Balancing\n",
       "Rock, and the long incline, and the cracked toppling walls, but failed\n",
       "to note the slightest change.\n",
       "\n",
       "The dogs led the descent; then came Bess leading her burro; then Venters\n",
       "leading his. Bess kept her eyes bent downward. Venters, however, had\n",
       "an irresistible desire to look upward at Balancing Rock. It had always\n",
       "haunted him, and now he wondered if he were really to get through the\n",
       "outlet before the huge stone thundered down. He fancied that would be\n",
       "a miracle. Every few steps he answered to the strange, nervous fear and\n",
       "turned to make sure the rock still stood like a giant statue. And, as\n",
       "he descended, it grew dimmer in his sight. It changed form; it swayed it\n",
       "nodded darkly; and at last, in his heightened fancy, he saw it heave and\n",
       "roll. As in a dream when he felt himself falling yet knew he would never\n",
       "fall, so he saw this long-standing thunderbolt of the little stone-men\n",
       "plunge down to close forever the outlet to Deception Pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "And while he was giving way to unaccountable dread imaginations the\n",
       "descent was accomplished without mishap.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm glad that's over,” he said, breathing more freely. “I hope I'm by\n",
       "that hanging rock for good and all. Since almost the moment I first saw\n",
       "it I've had an idea that it was waiting for me. Now, when it does fall,\n",
       "if I'm thousands of miles away, I'll hear it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "With the first glimpses of the smooth slope leading down to the\n",
       "grotesque cedars and out to the Pass, Venters's cool nerve returned. One\n",
       "long survey to the left, then one to the right, satisfied his caution.\n",
       "Leading the burros down to the spur of rock, he halted at the steep\n",
       "incline.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess, here's the bad place, the place I told you about, with the cut\n",
       "steps. You start down, leading your burro. Take your time and hold on to\n",
       "him if you slip. I've got a rope on him and a half-hitch on this point\n",
       "of rock, so I can let him down safely. Coming up here was a killing job.\n",
       "But it'll be easy going down.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Both burros passed down the difficult stairs cut by the cliff-dwellers,\n",
       "and did it without a misstep. After that the descent down the slope and\n",
       "over the mile of scrawled, ripped, and ridged rock required only careful\n",
       "guidance, and Venters got the burros to level ground in a condition that\n",
       "caused him to congratulate himself.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, if we only had Wrangle!” exclaimed Venters. “But we're lucky.\n",
       "That's the worst of our trail passed. We've only men to fear now. If we\n",
       "get up in the sage we can hide and slip along like coyotes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "They mounted and rode west through the valley and entered the canyon.\n",
       "From time to time Venters walked, leading his burro. When they got by\n",
       "all the canyons and gullies opening into the Pass they went faster and\n",
       "with fewer halts. Venters did not confide in Bess the alarming fact that\n",
       "he had seen horses and smoke less than a mile up one of the intersecting\n",
       "canyons. He did not talk at all. And long after he had passed this\n",
       "canyon and felt secure once more in the certainty that they had been\n",
       "unobserved he never relaxed his watchfulness. But he did not walk any\n",
       "more, and he kept the burros at a steady trot. Night fell before they\n",
       "reached the last water in the Pass and they made camp by starlight.\n",
       "Venters did not want the burros to stray, so he tied them with long\n",
       "halters in the grass near the spring. Bess, tired out and silent, laid\n",
       "her head in a saddle and went to sleep between the two dogs. Venters\n",
       "did not close his eyes. The canyon silence appeared full of the low,\n",
       "continuous hum of insects. He listened until the hum grew into a roar,\n",
       "and then, breaking the spell, once more he heard it low and clear. He\n",
       "watched the stars and the moving shadows, and always his glance returned\n",
       "to the girl's dimly pale face. And he remembered how white and still\n",
       "it had once looked in the starlight. And again stern thought fought his\n",
       "strange fancies. Would all his labor and his love be for naught? Would\n",
       "he lose her, after all? What did the dark shadow around her portend? Did\n",
       "calamity lurk on that long upland trail through the sage? Why should his\n",
       "heart swell and throb with nameless fear? He listened to the silence\n",
       "and told himself that in the broad light of day he could dispel this\n",
       "leaden-weighted dread.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the first hint of gray over the eastern rim he awoke Bess, saddled\n",
       "the burros, and began the day's travel. He wanted to get out of the Pass\n",
       "before there was any chance of riders coming down. They gained the break\n",
       "as the first red rays of the rising sun colored the rim.\n",
       "\n",
       "For once, so eager was he to get up to level ground, he did not send\n",
       "Ring or Whitie in advance. Encouraging Bess to hurry pulling at his\n",
       "patient, plodding burro, he climbed the soft, steep trail.\n",
       "\n",
       "Brighter and brighter grew the light. He mounted the last broken edge of\n",
       "rim to have the sun-fired, purple sage-slope burst upon him as a glory.\n",
       "Bess panted up to his side, tugging on the halter of her burro.\n",
       "\n",
       "“We're up!” he cried, joyously. “There's not a dot on the sage. We're\n",
       "safe. We'll not be seen! Oh, Bess--”\n",
       "\n",
       "Ring growled and sniffed the keen air and bristled. Venters clutched\n",
       "at his rifle. Whitie sometimes made a mistake, but Ring never. The dull\n",
       "thud of hoofs almost deprived Venters of power to turn and see from\n",
       "where disaster threatened. He felt his eyes dilate as he stared at\n",
       "Lassiter leading Black Star and Night out of the sage, with Jane\n",
       "Withersteen, in rider's costume, close beside them.\n",
       "\n",
       "For an instant Venters felt himself whirl dizzily in the center of vast\n",
       "circles of sage. He recovered partially, enough to see Lassiter standing\n",
       "with a glad smile and Jane riveted in astonishment.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why, Bern!” she exclaimed. “How good it is to see you! We're riding\n",
       "away, you see. The storm burst--and I'm a ruined woman!... I thought you\n",
       "were alone.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Venters, unable to speak for consternation, and bewildered out of all\n",
       "sense of what he ought or ought not to do, simply stared at Jane.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Son, where are you bound for?” asked Lassiter.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Not safe--where I was. I'm--we're going out of Utah--back East,” he\n",
       "found tongue to say.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I reckon this meetin's the luckiest thing that ever happened to you an'\n",
       "to me--an' to Jane--an' to Bess,” said Lassiter, coolly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess!” cried Jane, with a sudden leap of blood to her pale cheek.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was entirely beyond Venters to see any luck in that meeting.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane Withersteen took one flashing, woman's glance at Bess's scarlet\n",
       "face, at her slender, shapely form.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Venters! is this a girl--a woman?” she questioned, in a voice that\n",
       "stung.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Did you have her in that wonderful valley?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes, but Jane--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“All the time you were gone?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yes, but I couldn't tell--”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Was it for her you asked me to give you supplies? Was it for her that\n",

       "\n",
       "“Oh--Jane--”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“Yes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, you liar!” And with these passionate words Jane Withersteen\n",
       "succumbed to fury. For the second time in her life she fell into the\n",
       "ungovernable rage that had been her father's weakness. And it was worse\n",
       "than his, for she was a jealous woman--jealous even of her friends.\n",
       "\n",
       "As best he could, he bore the brunt of her anger. It was not only his\n",
       "deceit to her that she visited upon him, but her betrayal by religion,\n",
       "by life itself.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her passion, like fire at white heat, consumed itself in little time.\n",
       "Her physical strength failed, and still her spirit attempted to go on in\n",
       "magnificent denunciation of those who had wronged her. Like a tree\n",
       "cut deep into its roots, she began to quiver and shake, and her anger\n",
       "weakened into despair. And her ringing voice sank into a broken, husky\n",
       "whisper. Then, spent and pitiable, upheld by Lassiter's arm, she turned\n",
       "and hid her face in Black Star's mane.\n",
       "\n",
       "Numb as Venters was when at length Jane Withersteen lifted her head and\n",
       "looked at him, he yet suffered a pang.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, the girl is innocent!” he cried.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Can you expect me to believe that?” she asked, with weary, bitter eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm not that kind of a liar. And you know it. If I lied--if I kept\n",
       "silent when honor should have made me speak, it was to spare you. I came\n",
       "to Cottonwoods to tell you. But I couldn't add to your pain. I intended\n",
       "to tell you I had come to love this girl. But, Jane I hadn't forgotten\n",
       "how good you were to me. I haven't changed at all toward you. I prize\n",

       "Venters saw, and knew that Lassiter saw, how Jane Withersteen's tortured\n",
       "soul wrestled with hate and threw it--with scorn doubt, suspicion, and\n",
       "overcame all.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bern, if in my misery I accused you unjustly, I crave forgiveness,” she\n",

       "“Jane, she is Oldring's daughter, and his Masked Rider. Lassiter will\n",

       "It's a strange story, Jane, as wild as the sage. But it's true--true as\n",
       "her innocence. That you must believe.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oldring's Masked Rider! Oldring's daughter!” exclaimed Jane “And she's\n",

       "“Why did you tell that?” cried Venters, passionately.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane's question had roused Bess out of stupefaction. Her eyes suddenly\n",
       "darkened and dilated. She stepped toward Venters and held up both hands\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "knew it couldn't come true. You can't take me now.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“If you forgive me, Bess, it'll all come right in the end!” implored\n",
       "Venters.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It can't be right. I'll go back. After all, I loved him. He was good to\n",

       "\n",
       "“If you go back to Oldring's men I'll follow you, and then they'll kill\n",

       "\n",
       "She did not weep. But the sweet bloom and life died out of her face.\n",
       "She looked haggard and sad, all at once stunted; and her hands dropped\n",
       "listlessly; and her head drooped in slow, final acceptance of a hopeless\n",
       "fate.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, look there!” cried Venters, in despairing grief. “Need you have\n",

       "wretched, lonely life. And I'd found a way to make her happy. You've\n",

       "father made a mortal enemy of a Mormon named Dyer. They was both\n",
       "ministers an' come to be rivals. Dyer stole your mother away from her\n",
       "home. She gave birth to you in Texas eighteen years ago. Then she was\n",
       "taken to Utah, from place to place, an' finally to the last border\n",

       "taken away from Milly. She never knew what had become of you. But she\n",
       "lived a good while hopin' and prayin' to have you again. Then she gave\n",
       "up an' died. An' I may as well put in here your father died ten years\n",
       "ago. Well, I spent my time tracin' Milly, an' some months back I landed\n",
       "in Cottonwoods. An' jest lately I learned all about you. I had a talk\n",
       "with Oldrin' an' told him you was dead, an' he told me what I had so\n",
       "long been wantin' to know. It was Dyer, of course, who stole you from\n",
       "Milly. Part reason he was sore because Milly refused to give you Mormon\n",
       "teachin', but mostly he still hated Frank Erne so infernally that he\n",
       "made a deal with Oldrin' to take you an' bring you up as an infamous\n",
       "rustler an' rustler's girl. The idea was to break Frank Erne's heart\n",
       "if he ever came to Utah--to show him his daughter with a band of low\n",
       "rustlers. Well--Oldrin' took you, brought you up from childhood, an'\n",
       "then made you his Masked Rider. He made you infamous. He kept that part\n",
       "of the contract, but he learned to love you as a daughter an' never let\n",
       "any but his own men know you was a girl. I heard him say that with my\n",
       "own ears, an' I saw his big eyes grow dim. He told me how he had guarded\n",
       "you always, kept you locked up in his absence, was always at your side\n",
       "or near you on those rides that made you famous on the sage. He said he\n",
       "an' an old rustler whom he trusted had taught you how to read an' write.\n",
       "They selected the books for you. Dyer had wanted you brought up the\n",
       "vilest of the vile! An' Oldrin' brought you up the innocentest of the\n",
       "innocent. He said you didn't know what vileness was. I can hear his big\n",
       "voice tremble now as he said it. He told me how the men--rustlers an'\n",
       "outlaws--who from time to time tried to approach you familiarly--he told\n",
       "me how he shot them dead. I'm tellin' you this 'specially because you've\n",
       "showed such shame--sayin' you was nameless an' all that. Nothin' on\n",
       "earth can be wronger than that idea of yours. An' the truth of it is\n",

       "tremblings of all her slender body she rocked to and fro on her knees.\n",
       "The yearning wistfulness of her eyes changed to solemn splendor of joy.\n",
       "She believed. She was realizing happiness. And as the process of thought\n",
       "was slow, so were the variations of her expression. Her eyes reflected\n",
       "the transformation of her soul. Dark, brooding, hopeless belief--clouds\n",
       "of gloom--drifted, paled, vanished in glorious light. An exquisite rose\n",
       "flush--a glow--shone from her face as she slowly began to rise from her\n",
       "knees. A spirit uplifted her. All that she had held as base dropped from\n",
       "her.\n",
       "\n",

       "something of what Lassiter's revelation meant to Bess, but he knew he\n",
       "could only faintly understand. That moment when she seemed to be lifted\n",
       "by some spiritual transfiguration was the most beautiful moment of his\n",
       "life. She stood with parted, quivering lips, with hands tightly clasping\n",
       "the locket to her heaving breast. A new conscious pride of worth\n",
       "dignified the old wild, free grace and poise.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Uncle Jim!” she said, tremulously, with a different smile from any\n",

       "\n",
       "Lassiter took her into his arms.\n",
       "\n",

       "Venters, feeling his eyes grow hot and wet, turned away, and found\n",
       "himself looking at Jane Withersteen. He had almost forgotten her\n",
       "presence. Tenderness and sympathy were fast hiding traces of her\n",
       "agitation. Venters read her mind--felt the reaction of her noble\n",
       "heart--saw the joy she was beginning to feel at the happiness of others.\n",
       "And suddenly blinded, choked by his emotions, he turned from her also.\n",
       "He knew what she would do presently; she would make some magnificent\n",
       "amend for her anger; she would give some manifestation of her love;\n",
       "probably all in a moment, as she had loved Milly Erne, so would she love\n",

       "any longer. Even if we would be I'd take this chance to get her out.\n",
       "I want to marry her. She shall have some of the pleasures of life--see\n",

       "\n",
       "“Bess, I want you to know. Lassiter says the trip's almost useless now.\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“No, no! What are you doing?” he demanded, in a kind of fury. “I won't\n",

       "stop it, I say!... You've got her to save. You've miles and miles to go.\n",

       "\n",
       "“Son--cool down,” returned Lassiter, in a voice he might have used to a\n",
       "child. But the grip with which he tore away Venters's grasping hands was\n",
       "that of a giant. “Listen--you fool boy! Jane's sized up the situation.\n",
       "The burros'll do for us. We'll sneak along an' hide. I'll take your dogs\n",
       "an' your rifle. Why, it's the trick. The blacks are yours, an' sure as I\n",
       "can throw a gun you're goin' to ride safe out of the sage.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane--stop him--please stop him,” gasped Venters. “I've lost my\n",
       "strength. I can't do--anything. This is hell for me! Can't you see that?\n",
       "I've ruined you--it was through me you lost all. You've only Black Star\n",
       "and Night left. You love these horses. Oh! I know how you must love them\n",

       "Then in the white, rapt face, in the unfathomable eyes, Venters saw Jane\n",
       "Withersteen in a supreme moment. This moment was one wherein she reached\n",
       "up to the height for which her noble soul had ever yearned. He, after\n",
       "disrupting the calm tenor of her peace, after bringing down on her head\n",
       "the implacable hostility of her churchmen, after teaching her a bitter\n",
       "lesson of life--he was to be her salvation. And he turned away again,\n",
       "this time shaken to the core of his soul. Jane Withersteen was the\n",
       "incarnation of selflessness. He experienced wonder and terror, exquisite\n",
       "pain and rapture. What were all the shocks life had dealt him compared\n",
       "to the thought of such loyal and generous friendship?\n",
       "\n",
       "And instantly, as if by some divine insight, he knew himself in the\n",
       "remaking--tried, found wanting; but stronger, better, surer--and he\n",
       "wheeled to Jane Withersteen, eager, joyous, passionate, wild, exalted.\n",
       "He bent to her; he left tears and kisses on her hands.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, I--I can't find words--now,” he said. “I'm beyond words. Only--I\n",

       "“Don't be losin' no more time,” cut in Lassiter. “I ain't certain, but\n",

       "village, then cut off in the sage an' go round to the trail. But you'll\n",
       "most likely meet riders with Tull. Jest keep right on till you're jest\n",
       "out of gunshot an' then make your cut-off into the sage. They'll ride\n",

       "When you're out of reach turn on round to the west, an' hit the trail\n",
       "somewhere. Save the hosses all you can, but don't be afraid. Black Star\n",
       "and Night are good for a hundred miles before sundown, if you have to\n",
       "push them. You can get to Sterlin' by night if you want. But better make\n",
       "it along about to-morrow mornin'. When you get through the notch on the\n",

       "Stone Bridge. Keep away from them villages. You won't run no risk of\n",
       "meetin' any of Oldrin's rustlers from Sterlin' on. You'll find water in\n",

       "trotted for half an hour, for another half-hour, and still the moving\n",

       "\n",
       "Venters calculated that a mile or more still intervened between them\n",
       "and the riders. They were approaching at a swift canter. Soon Venters\n",
       "recognized Tull's white horse, and concluded that the riders had\n",
       "likewise recognized Black Star and Night. But it would be impossible for\n",
       "Tull yet to see that the blacks were not ridden by Lassiter and Jane.\n",
       "Venters noted that Tull and the line of horsemen, perhaps ten or twelve\n",
       "in number, stopped several times and evidently looked hard down the\n",
       "slope. It must have been a puzzling circumstance for Tull. Venters\n",
       "laughed grimly at the thought of what Tull's rage would be when he\n",
       "finally discovered the trick. Venters meant to sheer out into the sage\n",
       "before Tull could possibly be sure who rode the blacks.\n",
       "\n",
       "The gap closed to a distance of half a mile. Tull halted. His riders\n",

       "wave his arms and was certain of it when the riders dashed into the\n",
       "sage, to right and left of the trail. Tull had anticipated just the move\n",
       "held in mind by Venters.\n",

       "\n",
       "Black Star sailed over the low sage, and in a few leaps got into his\n",
       "stride and was running. Venters spurred Night after him. It was hard\n",
       "going in the sage. The horses could run as well there, but keen eyesight\n",
       "and judgment must constantly be used by the riders in choosing ground.\n",
       "And continuous swerving from aisle to aisle between the brush, and\n",
       "leaping little washes and mounds of the pack-rats, and breaking through\n",
       "sage, made rough riding. When Venters had turned into a long aisle he\n",
       "had time to look up at Tull's riders. They were now strung out into an\n",
       "extended line riding northeast. And, as Venters and Bess were holding\n",
       "due north, this meant, if the horses of Tull and his riders had the\n",
       "speed and the staying power, they would head the blacks and turn them\n",
       "back down the slope. Tull's men were not saving their mounts; they were\n",
       "driving them desperately. Venters feared only an accident to Black Star\n",
       "or Night, and skilful riding would mitigate possibility of that. One\n",
       "glance ahead served to show him that Bess could pick a course through\n",
       "the sage as well as he. She looked neither back nor at the running\n",
       "riders, and bent forward over Black Star's neck and studied the ground\n",
       "ahead.\n",
       "\n",
       "It struck Venters, presently, after he had glanced up from time to time,\n",
       "that Bess was drawing away from him as he had expected. He had, however,\n",
       "only thought of the light weight Black Star was carrying and of his\n",
       "superior speed; he saw now that the black was being ridden as never\n",
       "before, except when Jerry Card lost the race to Wrangle. How easily,\n",
       "gracefully, naturally, Bess sat her saddle! She could ride! Suddenly\n",
       "Venters remembered she had said she could ride. But he had not dreamed\n",
       "she was capable of such superb horsemanship. Then all at once, flashing\n",
       "over him, thrilling him, came the recollection that Bess was Oldring's\n",
       "Masked Rider.\n",
       "\n",
       "He forgot Tull--the running riders--the race. He let Night have a free\n",
       "rein and felt him lengthen out to suit himself, knowing he would keep to\n",
       "Black Star's course, knowing that he had been chosen by the best rider\n",
       "now on the upland sage. For Jerry Card was dead. And fame had rivaled\n",
       "him with only one rider, and that was the slender girl who now swung so\n",
       "easily with Black Star's stride. Venters had abhorred her notoriety, but\n",
       "now he took passionate pride in her skill, her daring, her power over\n",
       "a horse. And he delved into his memory, recalling famous rides which he\n",
       "had heard related in the villages and round the camp-fires. Oldring's\n",
       "Masked Rider! Many times this strange rider, at once well known and\n",
       "unknown, had escaped pursuers by matchless riding. He had to run the\n",
       "gantlet of vigilantes down the main street of Stone Bridge, leaving dead\n",
       "horses and dead rustlers behind. He had jumped his horse over the Gerber\n",
       "Wash, a deep, wide ravine separating the fields of Glaze from the\n",
       "wild sage. He had been surrounded north of Sterling; and he had broken\n",
       "through the line. How often had been told the story of day stampedes,\n",
       "of night raids, of pursuit, and then how the Masked Rider, swift as the\n",
       "wind, was gone in the sage! A fleet, dark horse--a slender, dark form--a\n",
       "black mask--a driving run down the slope--a dot on the purple sage--a\n",
       "shadowy, muffled steed disappearing in the night!\n",
       "\n",
       "And this Masked Rider of the uplands had been Elizabeth Erne!\n",
       "\n",
       "The sweet sage wind rushed in Venters's face and sang a song in his\n",
       "ears. He heard the dull, rapid beat of Night's hoofs; he saw Black Star\n",
       "drawing away, farther and farther. He realized both horses were swinging\n",
       "to the west. Then gunshots in the rear reminded him of Tull. Venters\n",
       "looked back. Far to the side, dropping behind, trooped the riders. They\n",
       "were shooting. Venters saw no puffs or dust, heard no whistling bullets.\n",
       "He was out of range. When he looked back again Tull's riders had given\n",
       "up pursuit. The best they could do, no doubt, had been to get near\n",
       "enough to recognize who really rode the blacks. Venters saw Tull\n",
       "drooping in his saddle.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Venters pulled Night out of his running stride. Those few miles had\n",
       "scarcely warmed the black, but Venters wished to save him. Bess turned,\n",
       "and, though she was far away, Venters caught the white glint of her\n",
       "waving hand. He held Night to a trot and rode on, seeing Bess and Black\n",
       "Star, and the sloping upward stretch of sage, and from time to time the\n",
       "receding black riders behind. Soon they disappeared behind a ridge, and\n",
       "he turned no more. They would go back to Lassiter's trail and follow it,\n",
       "and follow in vain. So Venters rode on, with the wind growing sweeter\n",
       "to taste and smell, and the purple sage richer and the sky bluer in his\n",
       "sight; and the song in his ears ringing. By and by Bess halted to wait\n",
       "for him, and he knew she had come to the trail. When he reached her it\n",
       "was to smile at sight of her standing with arms round Black Star's neck.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, Bern! I love him!” she cried. “He's beautiful; he knows; and how\n",
       "he can run! I've had fast horses. But Black Star!... Wrangle never beat\n",
       "him!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I'm wondering if I didn't dream that. Bess, the blacks are grand. What\n",
       "it must have cost Jane--ah!--well, when we get out of this wild country\n",
       "with Star and Night, back to my old home in Illinois, we'll buy a\n",
       "beautiful farm with meadows and springs and cool shade. There we'll turn\n",
       "the horses free--free to roam and browse and drink--never to feel a spur\n",
       "again--never to be ridden!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I would like that,” said Bess.\n",
       "\n",
       "They rested. Then, mounting, they rode side by side up the white trail.\n",
       "The sun rose higher behind them. Far to the left a low line of green\n",
       "marked the site of Cottonwoods. Venters looked once and looked no\n",
       "more. Bess gazed only straight ahead. They put the blacks to the\n",
       "long, swinging rider's canter, and at times pulled them to a trot, and\n",
       "occasionally to a walk. The hours passed, the miles slipped behind, and\n",
       "the wall of rock loomed in the fore. The Notch opened wide. It was a\n",
       "rugged, stony pass, but with level and open trail, and Venters and Bess\n",
       "ran the blacks through it. An old trail led off to the right, taking\n",
       "the line of the wall, and this Venters knew to be the trail mentioned by\n",
       "Lassiter.\n",
       "\n",
       "The little hamlet, Glaze, a white and green patch in the vast waste of\n",
       "purple, lay miles down a slope much like the Cottonwoods slope, only\n",
       "this descended to the west. And miles farther west a faint green spot\n",
       "marked the location of Stone Bridge. All the rest of that world was\n",
       "seemingly smooth, undulating sage, with no ragged lines of canyons to\n",
       "accentuate its wildness.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bess, we're safe--we're free!” said Venters. “We're alone on the sage.\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“No. But, dear, listen. Well go back some day, after years--ten years.\n",
       "Then we'll be forgotten. And our valley will be just as we left it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What if Balancing Rock falls and closes the outlet to the Pass?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I've thought of that. I'll pack in ropes and ropes. And if the outlet's\n",
       "closed we'll climb up the cliffs and over them to the valley and go down\n",
       "on rope ladders. It could be done. I know just where to make the climb,\n",
       "and I'll never forget.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh yes, let us go back!”\n",
       "\n",

       "looks to me.”\n",

       "\n",
       "So they rode on down the old trail. And the sun sloped to the west, and\n",
       "a golden sheen lay on the sage. The hours sped now; the afternoon waned.\n",
       "Often they rested the horses. The glisten of a pool of water in a hollow\n",
       "caught Venters's eye, and here he unsaddled the blacks and let them roll\n",
       "and drink and browse. When he and Bess rode up out of the hollow the sun\n",
       "was low, a crimson ball, and the valley seemed veiled in purple fire\n",
       "and smoke. It was that short time when the sun appeared to rest before\n",

       "still strong in body, but emotionally tired. That hour at the entrance\n",

       "\n",
       "Jane looked back over the long stretch of sage, and found the narrow gap\n",
       "in the wall, out of which came a file of dark horses with a white horse\n",
       "in the lead. Sight of the riders acted upon Jane as a stimulant. The\n",
       "weight of cold, horrible terror lessened. And, gazing forward at the\n",
       "dogs, at Lassiter's limping horse, at the blood on his face, at the\n",
       "rocks growing nearer, last at Fay's golden hair, the ice left her veins,\n",
       "and slowly, strangely, she gained hold of strength that she believed\n",
       "would see her to the safety Lassiter promised. And, as she gazed,\n",
       "Lassiter's horse stumbled and fell.\n",
       "\n",
       "He swung his leg and slipped from the saddle.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, take the child,” he said, and lifted Fay up. Jane clasped her\n",
       "arms suddenly strong. “They're gainin',” went on Lassiter, as he watched\n",
       "the pursuing riders. “But we'll beat 'em yet.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Turning with Jane's bridle in his hand, he was about to start when he\n",
       "saw the saddle-bag on the fallen horse.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I've jest about got time,” he muttered, and with swift fingers that\n",
       "did not blunder or fumble he loosened the bag and threw it over his\n",
       "shoulder. Then he started to run, leading Jane's horse, and he ran, and\n",
       "trotted, and walked, and ran again. Close ahead now Jane saw a rise of\n",
       "bare rock. Lassiter reached it, searched along the base, and, finding\n",
       "a low place, dragged the weary horse up and over round, smooth stone.\n",
       "Looking backward, Jane saw Tull's white horse not a mile distant, with\n",
       "riders strung out in a long line behind him. Looking forward, she saw\n",
       "more valley to the right, and to the left a towering cliff. Lassiter\n",
       "pulled the horse and kept on.\n",
       "\n",
       "Little Fay lay in her arms with wide-open eyes--eyes which were still\n",
       "shadowed by pain, but no longer fixed, glazed in terror. The golden\n",
       "curls blew across Jane's lips; the little hands feebly clasped her arm;\n",
       "a ghost of a troubled, trustful smile hovered round the sweet lips. And\n",
       "Jane Withersteen awoke to the spirit of a lioness.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lassiter was leading the horse up a smooth slope toward cedar trees of\n",
       "twisted and bleached appearance. Among these he halted.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane, give me the girl en' get down,” he said. As if it wrenched him he\n",
       "unbuckled the empty black guns with a strange air of finality. He then\n",
       "received Fay in his arms and stood a moment looking backward. Tull's\n",
       "white horse mounted the ridge of round stone, and several bays or blacks\n",
       "followed. “I wonder what he'll think when he sees them empty guns. Jane,\n",
       "bring your saddle-bag and climb after me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "A glistening, wonderful bare slope, with little holes, swelled up and\n",
       "up to lose itself in a frowning yellow cliff. Jane closely watched her\n",
       "steps and climbed behind Lassiter. He moved slowly. Perhaps he was only\n",
       "husbanding his strength. But she saw drops of blood on the stone, and\n",
       "then she knew. They climbed and climbed without looking back. Her breast\n",
       "labored; she began to feel as if little points of fiery steel were\n",
       "penetrating her side into her lungs. She heard the panting of Lassiter\n",
       "and the quicker panting of the dogs.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Wait--here,” he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before her rose a bulge of stone, nicked with little cut steps, and\n",
       "above that a corner of yellow wall, and overhanging that a vast,\n",
       "ponderous cliff.\n",
       "\n",
       "The dogs pattered up, disappeared round the corner. Lassiter mounted\n",
       "the steps with Fay, and he swayed like a drunken man, and he too\n",
       "disappeared. But instantly he returned alone, and half ran, half slipped\n",
       "down to her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then from below pealed up hoarse shouts of angry men. Tull and several\n",
       "of his riders had reached the spot where Lassiter had parted with his\n",
       "guns.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You'll need that breath--mebbe!” said Lassiter, facing downward, with\n",
       "glittering eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Now, Jane, the last pull,” he went on. “Walk up them little steps. I'll\n",
       "follow an' steady you. Don't think. Jest go. Little Fay's above. Her\n",
       "eyes are open. She jest said to me, 'Where's muvver Jane?'”\n",
       "\n",
       "Without a fear or a tremor or a slip or a touch of Lassiter's hand Jane\n",
       "Withersteen walked up that ladder of cut steps.\n",
       "\n",
       "He pushed her round the corner of the wall. Fay lay, with wide staring\n",
       "eyes, in the shade of a gloomy wall. The dogs waited. Lassiter picked\n",
       "up the child and turned into a dark cleft. It zigzagged. It widened.\n",
       "It opened. Jane was amazed at a wonderfully smooth and steep incline\n",
       "leading up between ruined, splintered, toppling walls. A red haze\n",
       "from the setting sun filled this passage. Lassiter climbed with slow,\n",
       "measured steps, and blood dripped from him to make splotches on the\n",
       "white stone. Jane tried not to step in his blood, but was compelled, for\n",
       "she found no other footing. The saddle-bag began to drag her down; she\n",
       "gasped for breath, she thought her heart was bursting. Slower, slower\n",
       "yet the rider climbed, whistling as he breathed. The incline widened.\n",
       "Huge pinnacles and monuments of stone stood alone, leaning fearfully.\n",
       "Red sunset haze shone through cracks where the wall had split. Jane did\n",
       "not look high, but she felt the overshadowing of broken rims above.\n",
       "She felt that it was a fearful, menacing place. And she climbed on in\n",
       "heartrending effort. And she fell beside Lassiter and Fay at the top of\n",
       "the incline in a narrow, smooth divide.\n",
       "\n",
       "He staggered to his feet--staggered to a huge, leaning rock that rested\n",
       "on a small pedestal. He put his hand on it--the hand that had been shot\n",
       "through--and Jane saw blood drip from the ragged hole. Then he fell.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Jane--I--can't--do--it!” he whispered.\n",

       "\n",
       "As Jane Withersteen gazed down that long incline, walled in by crumbling\n",
       "cliffs, awaiting only the slightest jar to make them fall asunder,\n",
       "she saw Tull appear at the bottom and begin to climb. A rider followed\n",
       "him--another--and another.\n",
       "\n",

       "Less than 1 year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American People — and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams.  That night, our new Administration had already taken swift action.  A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land.\n",
       "\n",
       "Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission — to make America great again for all Americans.\n",
       "\n",
       "Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success.  We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined.  We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship.  We endured floods and fires and storms.  But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America’s soul, and the steel in America’s spine.\n",
       "\n",
       "Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be.\n",
       "\n",
       "We saw the volunteers of the “Cajun Navy,” racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane.\n",
       "\n",
       "We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.\n",
       "\n",
       "We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania.  Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during Hurricane Harvey.  Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water, to help save more than 40 lives.  Thank you, Ashlee.\n",
       "\n",
       "We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg.  He is here with us too.  David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by wildfires.\n",
       "\n",
       "To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California, and everywhere else — we are with you, we love you, and we will pull through together.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally.  With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House — a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later:  the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise.\n",
       "\n",
       "We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police Officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life, and the lives of many others in this room.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people.  But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy.  Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve.\n",
       "\n",
       "Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew:  that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans.  If there is a mountain, we climb it.  If there is a frontier, we cross it.  If there is a challenge, we tame it.  If there is an opportunity, we seize it.\n",
       "\n",
       "So let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong.\n",
       "\n",
       "And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.\n",
       "\n",
       "Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone.  After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.\n",
       "\n",
       "Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low.  African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.\n",
       "\n",
       "Small business confidence is at an all-time high.  The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value.  That is great news for Americans’ 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts.\n",
       "\n",
       "And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses.\n",
       "\n",
       "To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone.  Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free.  We also doubled the child tax credit.\n",
       "\n",
       "A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 — slashing their tax bill in half.\n",
       "\n",
       "This April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system — and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month.\n",
       "\n",
       "We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year — forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans.  We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare — the individual mandate is now gone.\n",
       "\n",
       "We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the world.  These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000.\n",
       "\n",
       "Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing — a small business in Ohio.  They have just finished the best year in their 20-year history.  Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door.\n",
       "\n",
       "One of Staub’s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight.  Corey is an all-American worker.  He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder.  Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax‑cut raise into his new home and his two daughters’ education.  Please join me in congratulating Corey.\n",
       "\n",
       "Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands of dollars per worker.  Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers.\n",
       "\n",
       "This is our new American moment.  There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.\n",
       "\n",
       "So to every citizen watching at home tonight — no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time.  If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything.\n",
       "\n",
       "Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of Nation we are going to be.  All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family.\n",
       "\n",
       "We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag.\n",
       "\n",
       "Together, we are rediscovering the American way.\n",
       "\n",
       "In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life.  Our motto is “in God we trust.”\n",
       "\n",
       "And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans’ graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day.  He decided to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes.  Preston:  a job well done.\n",
       "\n",
       "Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans.  Preston’s reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.\n",
       "\n",
       "Americans love their country.  And they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government.\n",
       "\n",
       "Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country.\n",
       "\n",
       "We are defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty.\n",
       "\n",
       "And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions.  Last year, the Congress passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act.  Since its passage, my Administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve — and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do.\n",
       "\n",
       "I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.\n",
       "\n",
       "All Americans deserve accountability and respect — and that is what we are giving them.  So tonight, I call on the Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers — and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.\n",
       "\n",
       "In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history.\n",
       "\n",
       "We have ended the war on American Energy — and we have ended the war on clean coal.  We are now an exporter of energy to the world.\n",
       "\n",
       "In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America’s autoworkers — so we can get the Motor City revving its engines once again.\n",
       "\n",
       "Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States — something we have not seen for decades.    Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama.  Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country.  This is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing — for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us.  But now they are coming back.\n",
       "\n",
       "Exciting progress is happening every day.\n",
       "\n",
       "To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history.\n",
       "\n",
       "We also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives.\n",
       "\n",
       "People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure — I want to give them a chance right here at home.  It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the “right to try.”\n",
       "\n",
       "One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.  In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States.  That is why I have directed my Administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities.  Prices will come down.\n",
       "\n",
       "America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our Nation’s wealth.\n",
       "\n",
       "The era of economic surrender is over.\n",
       "\n",
       "From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal.\n",
       "\n",
       "We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones.\n",
       "\n",
       "And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules.\n",
       "\n",
       "As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.\n",
       "\n",
       "America is a nation of builders.  We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year — is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?\n",
       "\n",
       "I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve.\n",
       "\n",
       "Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need.\n",
       "\n",
       "Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment — to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit.\n",
       "\n",
       "Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process — getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one.\n",
       "\n",
       "Together, we can reclaim our building heritage.  We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land.  And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit.\n",
       "\n",
       "We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day’s work.  We want every child to be safe in their home at night.  And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love.\n",
       "\n",
       "We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.\n",
       "\n",
       "As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training.  Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential.  And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave.\n",
       "\n",
       "As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens.  That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.\n",
       "\n",
       "Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.\n",
       "\n",
       "For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities.  They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans.  Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers:  Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens.  Their two teenage daughters — Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens — were close friends on Long Island.  But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa’s 16th Birthday, neither of them came home.  These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown.  Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa’s murders.  Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors ‑- and wound up in Kayla and Nisa’s high school.\n",
       "\n",
       "Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert:  Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you.  Everyone in America is grieving for you.  And 320 million hearts are breaking for you.  We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain.\n",
       "\n",
       "Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country.  We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, so that this cannot ever happen again.\n",
       "\n",
       "The United States is a compassionate nation.  We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world.  But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for America’s children, America’s struggling workers, and America’s forgotten communities.  I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things.  I want our poor to have their chance to rise.\n",
       "\n",
       "So tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties — Democrats and Republicans — to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed.  My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans — to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream.  Because Americans are dreamers too.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country:  Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez — he goes by CJ.  CJ served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our streets.  At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ’s murder.  But he did not cave to threats or fear.  Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island.  His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS-13.\n",
       "\n",
       "CJ:  Great work.  Now let us get the Congress to send you some reinforcements.\n",
       "\n",
       "Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package.\n",
       "\n",
       "In recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform.  Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise — one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here are the four pillars of our plan:\n",
       "\n",
       "The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age — that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration.  Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States.\n",
       "\n",
       "The second pillar fully secures the border.  That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe.  Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country — and it finally ends the dangerous practice of “catch and release.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The third pillar ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people.  It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system — one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.\n",
       "\n",
       "The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration.  Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.  Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children.  This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future.\n",
       "\n",
       "In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration.  In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century.\n",
       "\n",
       "These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.\n",
       "\n",
       "For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem.  This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.\n",
       "\n",
       "Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first.  So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.\n",
       "\n",
       "These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.\n",
       "\n",
       "In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses:  174 deaths per day.  Seven per hour.  We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.\n",
       "\n",
       "My Administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need.  The struggle will be long and difficult — but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.\n",
       "\n",
       "As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America.\n",
       "\n",
       "We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico.  Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department.  He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca.  Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin.  When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep.  She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.\n",
       "\n",
       "In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him:  “You will do it — because you can.”  He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids.  Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca.  In an instant, she agreed to adopt.  The Holets named their new daughter Hope.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ryan and Rebecca:  You embody the goodness of our Nation.  Thank you, and congratulations.\n",
       "\n",
       "As we rebuild America’s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.\n",
       "\n",
       "Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values.  In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense.\n",
       "\n",
       "For this reason, I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military.\n",
       "\n",
       "As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression.  Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons.  Unfortunately, we are not there yet.\n",
       "\n",
       "Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth.  One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria.  But there is much more work to be done.  We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.\n",
       "\n",
       "Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight.  Near Raqqa last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city.\n",
       "\n",
       "Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion.  Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape.  He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway.  He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery.\n",
       "\n",
       "Kenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin’s selfless love for a fellow warrior.  Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas.  Raqqa is liberated.  And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a “V” for “Valor.”  Staff Sergeant Peck:  All of America salutes you.\n",
       "\n",
       "Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil.  When possible, we annihilate them.  When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them.  But we must be clear:  Terrorists are not merely criminals.  They are unlawful enemy combatants.  And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield — including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi.\n",
       "\n",
       "So today, I am keeping another promise.  I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay.\n",
       "\n",
       "I am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al-Qa’ida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists — wherever we chase them down.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement.  Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.\n",
       "\n",
       "Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate just months before:  I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n",
       "\n",
       "Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America’s sovereign right to make this recognition.  American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year.\n",
       "\n",
       "That is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America’s friends.\n",
       "\n",
       "As we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent.  America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.\n",
       "\n",
       "I am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.\n",
       "\n",
       "My Administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.\n",
       "\n",
       "But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.\n",
       "\n",
       "North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.\n",
       "\n",
       "We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening.\n",
       "\n",
       "Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation.  I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.\n",
       "\n",
       "We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies.\n",
       "\n",
       "Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia.  On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea.  At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state.  After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June — horribly injured and on the verge of death.  He passed away just days after his return.\n",
       "\n",
       "Otto’s Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight — along with Otto’s brother and sister, Austin and Greta.  You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all.  Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto’s memory with American resolve.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime.  His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho.\n",
       "\n",
       "In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea.  One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food.  In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger.  He woke up as a train ran over his limbs.  He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain.  His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves — permanently stunting their own growth.  Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China.  His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians.  He had — and he resolved to be free.\n",
       "\n",
       "Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom.  Most of his family followed.  His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death.\n",
       "\n",
       "Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most ‑- the truth.\n",
       "\n",
       "Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come.  Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.\n",
       "\n",
       "Seong-ho’s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America.  It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness.  But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea:  that they could rule themselves.  That they could chart their own destiny.  And that, together, they could light up the world.\n",
       "\n",
       "That is what our country has always been about.  That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.\n",
       "\n",
       "Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom.  She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Monuments to Washington and Jefferson — to Lincoln and King.\n",
       "\n",
       "Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga — to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond.  And others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia.\n",
       "\n",
       "And freedom stands tall over one more monument:  this one.  This Capitol.  This living monument to the American people.\n",
       "\n",
       "A people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us — defending hope, pride, and the American way.\n",
       "\n",
       "They work in every trade.  They sacrifice to raise a family.  They care for our children at home.  They defend our flag abroad.  They are strong moms and brave kids.  They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines.\n",
       "\n",
       "But above all else, they are Americans.  And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Americans fill the world with art and music.  They push the bounds of science and discovery.  And they forever remind us of what we should never forget:  The people dreamed this country. The people built this country.  And it is the people who are making America great again.\n",
       "\n",
       "As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve.\n",
       "\n",
       "As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our families will thrive.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our people will prosper.\n",
       "\n",
       "And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thank you, and God bless America.\n",
